instructions: ["Wash and dry the watermelon.","Position the watermelon with the stem spot at one end, and cut the watermelon in half. You should have 2 equal-sized, round halves. ","Take one half of the watermelon and lay it, cut side down, on a cutting board.","Cut it in half again. Place one half with the rind facing up. Set the other half aside.","Cut 1-inch slices by pressing downward toward the cutting board. Repeat the steps with the rest of the watermelon.","Wash and dry the watermelon.","Position the watermelon with the stem at one end, and cut the watermelon in half. You should have 2 equal-sized, round halves. Cut the ends off.","Take one half of the watermelon and lay it on a cutting board, with the widest cut side down and the more narrow end at the top.","Very carefully, cut the rind off the watermelon by cutting down toward the cutting board and away from you. There may be parts of pith or rind left and that’s ok. You can go back and trim more away after you have cut away most of the rind.","Next, cut the watermelon into 1-inch round slices by cutting horizontally. If you find this too challenging, you can flip the watermelon and cut in a downward motion toward the cutting board to make the slices. Return the watermelon to the original position by stacking the circle layers vertically.","Then, cut the watermelon into 1-inch slices by cutting down toward the cutting board.","For the final step, turn the watermelon a quarter turn and cut the watermelon into 1-inch slices, creating a grid-like pattern. This will create cubes that are about 1-inch square.","Repeat with the other half.","Wash and dry the watermelon.","Position the watermelon with the step spot at one end, and cut the watermelon in half.
