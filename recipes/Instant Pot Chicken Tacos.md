instructions: ["Pour chicken broth into the Instant Pot. Add chicken breasts in a single layer. Sprinkle taco seasoning over the chicken breasts. Top with salsa.","Secure the lid and make sure the pressure valve is set to SEALING. Select the HIGH PRESSURE (or manual cook mode) and set the timer for 15 minutes.","When the timer is done, let the pressure naturally release for 10 minutes and then manually release the rest of the pressure. ","Remove chicken breast and place them on a cutting board or plate. Shred the chicken with two forks.","Drain about ¼ cup of liquid from the Instant Pot into a measuring cup.
