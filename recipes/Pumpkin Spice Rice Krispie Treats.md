instructions: ["Line a 9-inch square baking pan with foil. Grease the foil with butter (I use the butter wrapper to grease the foil dish). Or use parchment paper. Set aside.","In a large pot, melt butter over medium heat. Add in marshmallows and stir constantly until melted (reduce heat to low). Remove from heat and quickly stir in pudding mix and pumpkin spice. Fold in cereal.","Pour mixture into buttered foil pan.
