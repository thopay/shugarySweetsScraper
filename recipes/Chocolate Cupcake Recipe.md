instructions: ["Preheat oven to 350 degree F. Prepare cupcake tin with cupcake liners. Set aside.","In a large mixing bowl, add chopped chocolate and cocoa powder. Pour hot coffee over both, then stir until chocolate is melted.","Add sugar, flour, kosher salt, baking soda and baking powder. Add in vanilla extract, eggs, vegetable oil, and buttermilk. Beat for about 4 minutes, scraping down the sides of the mixing bowl several times (and the bottom too to make sure the chocolate doesn't settle).","The batter will be thin, that's okay! Using a large cookie scoop, spoon batter into prepared cupcake tins, about 2/3 full. Bake for 18-20 minutes, until a toothpick in the center comes out clean, or the cupcake springs back from a touch of your finger. Remove and cool completely on wire rack.","Beat butter in large mixing bowl for 3-5 minutes, until pale in color and fluffy. Add in powdered sugar, milk, and cocoa powder. Beat an additional 3-5 minutes until fluffy. Slowly add in chocolate syrup, beating until smooth.","Pipe frosting onto cupcakes and enjoy!"]
