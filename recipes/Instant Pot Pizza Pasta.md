prepTime: "5 minutes"
instructions: ["Turn Instant Pot on SAUTE. Add olive oil, Italian Sausage (bulk, not the links), and diced onion. Cook until sausage is crumbled and browned (about 8-10 minutes). Turn pressure cooker off.","Add broth to pot with sausage and using a wooden spoon, scrape the bottom of the pot to remove all the bits of browned meat (this is called deglazing, and when done correctly will prevent a burn notice).","Add Italian seasoning and red pepper flakes, stir everything together.","Add fresh mushrooms and green pepper, DO NOT STIR. Add the uncooked pasta and DO NOT STIR.","Pour both jars of sauce over the uncooked pasta, without stirring, spread so no pasta is visible. DO NOT STIR.","Top with slices of mini pepperoni.","Secure the lid and make sure the valve is set to SEALING. Select HIGH PRESSURE or MANUAL and set a cook time of 4 minutes. The pot will take awhile to come to pressure because of the large amount of contents.","When the cook time ends, do a quick release of pressure by moving the valve on top to VENTING.","Once the pressure is released, open the lid away from your face, and stir everything together. Add black olives and cheese, stir and serve hot."]
