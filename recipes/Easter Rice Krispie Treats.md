instructions: ["Start by making a batch of rice krispie treats. (or use 10 store bought krispie treats, unwrapped).","After letting the krispie treats set, remove from pan by lifting by the parchment paper. Place on a cutting board and cut in half horizontally, then cut rectangles to make 10 large treats. ","Melt white chocolate in a glass bowl in microwave according to package directions. I use Ghirardelli white chocolate melting wafers for best results.","Dunk one side of each rice krispie treat in the melted white chocolate (spreading evenly with an offset spatula if needed) and sprinkled with colored sanding sugar (or any pastel sprinkles) immediately. Place on parchment paper.","Attach one bunny PEEP to each with a dollop of melted white chocolate. Set and enjoy."]
