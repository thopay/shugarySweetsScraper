instructions: ["You'll need about 1 cup of coarse ground coffee beans. Add the ground coffee with 4 cups of COLD water to a pitcher. Stir and refrigerate for 12-24 hours.","Place a strainer with cheesecloth over a large pitcher or bowl. Slowly pour coffee (with grounds) into the cheesecloth lined strainer until all the liquid has filtered through.","Dilute cold brew concentrate with a 2:1 ratio of cold water: concentrate. I usually just add an additional 4 cups of cold water. If you like it REALLY strong, use less water at this point.","In a saucepan, combine heavy cream, sugar, pumpkin puree, and pumpkin spice. Whisk over medium heat until sugar is dissolved and cream mixture begins to steam. DO NOT BOIL.","Remove from heat and whisk in the vanilla extract. Strain through a fine mesh strainer and transfer to a pint sized mason jar (or pitcher). Refrigerate until cool.","Once chilled, use an Aerolatte or milk frother to froth the pumpkin cream. Or shake vigorously in mason jar.","Fill large glass with ice. Add cold brew coffee, leaving space for cream.","Pour in desired amount of frothy pumpkin cream. ENJOY."]
