prepTime: "15 minutes"
instructions: ["Mix dry ingredients together in a large bowl. Whisk in buttermilk, butter, eggs, and vanilla. Mix just until combined. Batter will be slightly lumpy. Let rest for 5 to 10 minutes.","Meanwhile, preheat skillet or griddle over medium heat.","When skillet is sizzling hot, melt 1 tablespoon butter or coconut oil. Carefully pour or ladle about ¼ cup batter per pancake (I can fit 4 silver dollar sized pancakes in my 12” skillet at a time).","When batter starts to bubble near the edges of pancake, it’s time to flip. Cook other side for about 1 minute, or until golden brown.","Remove to warming plate and continue cooking remaining batter as above.","Serve warm with butter and syrup or your favorite pancake toppings.","Place water and berries in a small saucepan and heat, covered, until water starts to boil.","Turn burner down to low, uncover and simmer until berries are soft and half of the water has cooked off, stirring occasionally.","Smash berries a bit with back of a spoon to release juices. You could also puree in a blender at this point if you don’t like lumpy syrup (I never do, I don’t mind the lumps)","Add syrup and stir and allow to heat through for a couple more minutes."]
