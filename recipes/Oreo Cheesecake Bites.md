instructions: ["For the crust, process cookies until crumbs. Melt butter and mix with cookie crumbs until completely combined. Press into bottom of 8-inch square baking dish that is lined with foil. Really press those crumbs evenly, may take a minute or two, don't worry, there are enough!","Bake crust in a 350 degree oven for about 8 minutes. Remove and cool slightly while preparing cheesecake filling.","For filling, in a double boiler, heat heavy cream on low until warm. Add in chocolate chips and stir continuously until chips are melted. Set aside.","In mixer, beat cream cheese with sugar and cornstarch until fluffy. Beat in the sour cream, vanilla and eggs. Slowly beat in the chocolate mixture. Pour into prepared crust. Bake in a 300 degree oven for about 35 minutes. Turn oven off, and let cheesecake remain in oven an additional 20 minutes.","Remove and cool. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours. Cut into small bites before garnishing.","For the garnish, beat butter with powdered sugar, marshmallow cream, and heavy cream on high for about 3-4 minutes until fluffy. Put in a pastry bag and using a star tip (or french tip) pipe a small swirl on each bite. Top with one mini Oreo. Enjoy!"]
