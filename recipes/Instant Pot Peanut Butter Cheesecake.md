instructions: ["Process Oreo cookies until a fine crumb (using a food processor works best, but you could use a rolling pin in a pinch if you need to).

Blend until smooth (this may take a few minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed).","Beat in heavy whipping cream, vanilla extract, and flour. Add eggs one at a time.","Pour cheesecake into prepared crust.","Cover top of cheesecake pan with foil. Then lay a long piece of foil on counter. Place cheesecake pan in the center and wrap up the sides.","Place cheesecake on trivet that came with the Instant Pot or use a sling if you prefer.","Pour one cup of water into the bottom of the instant pot. Lower trivet with cheesecake into the pressure cooker.","Secure the lid and move valve to \"SEALING.\"","Select \"HIGH PRESSURE\" and cook time of 50 minutes.","Once time is complete, allow to release pressure naturally, for about 20 minutes. Remove the lid and allow cheesecake to cool to room temperature.","Place cooked cheesecake in refrigerator for at least 4 hours, or overnight.","For the ganache, add chocolate chips and heavy whipping cream to a microwave safe glass bowl.","Microwave for 30 seconds, stir until smooth. Pour over cooled cheesecake and top with Reese's peanut butter cups.","Allow to set or enjoy immediately.Â "]
