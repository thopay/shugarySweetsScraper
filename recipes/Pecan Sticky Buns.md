time: "3 hours"
prepTime: "30 minutes"
instructions: ["In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine the warmed milk with sugars and yeast. Lightly whisk, then let the yeast proof for about 5 minutes.","Add in butter, eggs and vanilla extract, mix to combine.","Using the dough hook attachment, add in salt and flour. Mix on medium speed until a soft dough begins to form.","Once all the flour has been added, increase the speed to medium high and been for about 5 minutes longer, kneading the dough until it is soft and supple.","Transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl. Cover with a tea towel or plastic wrap. Allow the dough to rise for about one hour (in a warm, dry place), until it doubles in size.","Lightly grease the bottom and sides of a 13x9 baking dish (we use the deepest one we own)! Spread pecans in the bottom of the baking dish. Set aside.","In a medium saucepan, over medium heat, combine brown sugar, butter, milk, and salt. Cook until it begins to simmer.","Once simmering, cook for 2 full minutes. Remove from heat. Pour into the baking dish, over the pecans. Do not stir. Set aside.","Turn the dough after it has risen onto a lightly floured counter. Using a rolling pin, roll dough to about a 15x21-inch rectangle. Spread softened butter over the rolled out dough.","In a small bowl, combine sugars and cinnamon. Sprinkle over butter on the dough.","Roll dough into a log, rolling the long side up. Cut the dough into 12 equal pieces. Place each sticky bun into the baking dish, on top of the pecan mixture.","Cover the rolls with plastic wrap and allow to rise for an additional hour.","Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.","Bake uncovered for about 30-35 minutes. Halfway through the bake time, cover loosely with foil to keep the rolls from browning too quickly.","Remove from oven and allow to cool about 5 minutes on wire rack (or stove top). Using hot pad or oven mitts, place a platter (or a wire rack) over the top of the baking dish. Flip both the dish and platter together to release the buns (the pecan topping will now be on top). Serve warm."]
