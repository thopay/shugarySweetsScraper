serves: 6
time: "6 hours 35 minutes"
prepTime: "5 minutes"
instructions: ["In the bottom of a large slow cooker, combine sweet chili sauce, chicken broth, salt, pepper, and soy sauce. Whisk together. Add in chicken thighs on top of glaze, and spoon some of the glaze over the top of the chicken.","Cover and cook on low for 6 hours (do not open the lid while cooking, you want to maintain the moisture inside!)","To thicken the sauce (optional), remove the chicken and cut into bite sized pieces. Before returning chicken to the crockpot, thicken the sauce by whisking the broth and cornstarch together in a small glass. Pour into the glaze and stir. Add cooked chicken, cover and allow to cook about 20-30 minutes more (perfect amount of time to make some cilantro lime rice)!","To serve, add the snipped cilantro over the top, stir, and enjoy!"]
