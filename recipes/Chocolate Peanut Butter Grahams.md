instructions: ["In a glass bowl, combine white chocolate chips (I prefer to use Ghirardelli) and creamy peanut butter. Microwave for 30 seconds, stir and heat an additional 30 seconds. Stir until smooth (if necessary heat an additional 15 seconds).","Line counter with parchment paper. Dip half of the graham cracker into the melted white chocolate PB combo. Tap gently until excess is removed and lay on parchment. Repeat with remaining grahams. Heat milk chocolate chips for 30 seconds in glass bowl in microwave. Stir and heat an additional 30 seconds. At this point the white chocolate should be hardened. Holding the tip of the graham. dip opposite side of cracker into melted milk chocolate, tap and lay on parchment. Repeat until all grahams are dipped.","If desired and you want to decorate tops, reheat excess chocolate for 10-15 seconds. Pour white chocolate PB into a small ziploc bag. Snip off the corner and drizzle of milk chocolate dipped grahams. Repeat with the milk chocolate onto the white chocolate side of the cracker. Allow to set, about 15-30 minutes.
