instructions: ["Add shredded coconut to a skillet and toast over medium low heat, until golden brown and fragrant (about 3-5 minutes.) Make sure that the skillet is large enough that the coconut can be spread out in an even layer.  Stir frequently to prevent the coconut from burning. Transfer the toasted coconut to a piece of parchment paper and cool completely before using.","In a large bowl, combine marshmallow cream with vanilla and cooled, toasted coconut. Stir gently until combined. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.","Using a 1 tablespoon scoop, drop onto a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Refrigerate an additional hour or two.","Using a toothpick or a fork, dip each truffle into the melted chocolate, tapping the side of the bowl until the excess drips off. Drop onto the parchment paper and add sprinkles immediately. Repeat until all truffles have been dipped.","Store truffles for up to two weeks in an airtight container at room temperature. ENJOY."]
