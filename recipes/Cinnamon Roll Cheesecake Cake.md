prepTime: "1 hour"
instructions: ["Preheat oven to 325°F. Using a large roasting pan on the lower 1/3 of the oven, preheat the pan.","Prepare 9-inch springform pan by wrapping the bottom of the pan (outside) with a double layer of foil. Spray pan with nonstick baking spray and line the bottom (inside) with a circle of parchment paper. Meanwhile, boil several cups of water.","Beat cream cheese with sugar and salt until creamy and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes. Add in eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in sour cream, heavy cream and cinnamon. Pour into prepared springform pan. Place pan in the center of the preheated roasting pan. Pour boiling water, slowly, into the roasting pan, until about 1-inch of water comes up the sides of the springform pan.","Bake cheesecake for 45 minutes. Turn oven off and let cheesecake sit an additional 30 minutes in oven (without opening oven door). Remove from oven and cool completely in the pan.","Refrigerate cheesecake for 4 hours, or overnight.","Preheat oven to 350°F. Line the bottom of 2 (9-inch) cake pans with parchment paper. Grease the sides with baking spray. Set aside.","In a large mixing bowl, beat the butter and sugar together on medium speed until light in color and fluffy, about 3-4 minutes. Add the sour cream and vanilla extract, and mix until combined. Add in egg whites and beat until combined.","In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, cinnamon and salt. Set aside.","In a small measuring cup, combine the milk and water. Set aside.","Add half of the flour mixture to the cake batter bowl and beat until combined. Add half the milk mixture. Repeat, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.","Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Bake for 35 minutes. Remove from oven and cool for about 5 minutes in pan. Then remove from pans onto a wire rack and cool completely.","Add the powdered sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon to a small bowl. Whisk to combine, slowly adding the water, stirring until smooth. Set aside.","Beat the butter for 3 minutes until fluffy and pale in color. Add in vanilla, powdered sugar, cinnamon and milk.","Beat an additional 3-4 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Set aside.","Place first layer of cake on a cake stand. Pour about half of the cinnamon glaze over the top of the cake, being careful not to let it drip past the edges.","Top with layer of cheesecake. Pour remaining half of the cinnamon glaze over the top of the cheesecake layer.","Add the second layer of cake. Spread frosting over sides and top of cake. You can reserve about a cup of the frosting to add to a decorator bag with a tip to make swirls on top (or use the instructions in the cookbook to make a beautiful design). Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar topping if desired.","Serve cold and enjoy!!!!"]
