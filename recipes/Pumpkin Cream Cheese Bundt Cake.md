Set aside.","In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients for the cake, mixing until well combined. Set aside.","For the filling, in a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese with sugar, maple and egg until smooth and creamy (about 2-3 minutes). Set aside.","To assemble, fill bottom of sprayed bundt pan with about 1/2 of the batter. Spoon the cream cheese mixture into the pan, being careful not to let it touch the sides of the pan. Spoon the remaining batter over the cream cheese layer.","Bake cake in oven for 60-65 minutes. Cake will be browned and pull away from the pan when done. Remove from oven and cool 5-10 minutes in pan. Invert cake onto a cake plate and cool completely before adding frosting.","For the frosting, beat cream cheese, milk, maple, and powdered sugar together until smooth (about 3 minutes). If frosting the whole cake, spread over cooled cake and sprinkle immediately with chopped pecans. If you would rather have a thinner glaze, add a little extra milk and whisk smooth. Drizzle over cooled cake and add pecans."]
