ingredients: ["1 cup graham cracker crumbs (about 1 sleeve, or 9 full size crackers)","2 Tbsp granulated sugar","5 Tbsp unsalted butter, melted","2 packages (8 oz each) cream cheese, room temperature","2/3 cup granulated sugar","2 large eggs, room temperature","1/2 cup pure pumpkin puree","1/4 cup sour cream","2 tsp pumpkin pie spice","1 tsp vanilla extract","1/4 cup all-purpose flour","1 cup COLD heavy whipping cream","1/4 cup powdered sugar"]
serves: 8
time: "8 hours 50 minutes"
prepTime: "15 minutes"
instructions: ["In a food processor, pulse the graham crackers with granulated sugar until fine crumbs. Add in melted butter and mix until combined.","Press the crumbs into the bottom (and partially up the sides) of a 7-inch cheesecake pan. Set aside.","In a large mixing bowl, combine the cream cheese and granulated sugar. Mix until smooth. Beat in eggs, one at a time.","Add pumpkin, sour cream, pumpkin pie spice, vanilla extract, and all-purpose flour. Mix just until everything is blended.","Pour the filling into the prepared crust.","Wrap the top of the cheesecake in aluminum foil. Then place the cheesecake on a second, large piece of foil, wrapping the sides of foil up over the top of the covered cheesecake. Press the foil snug onto the pan.","Add 1 cup of water to the bottom of the Instant Pot. Place the foil wrapped cheesecake pan on the trivet (I use the one that came with my pressure cooker) and lower into the pressure cooker.","Secure lid and turn valve to \"SEALING.\" Select high pressure for 35 minutes.","When the cook time ends, allow to naturally release pressure completely (this takes about 20-30 minutes).","Remove cheesecake from Instant Pot by lifting up the trivet by the handles. Allow cheesecake to cool completely to room temperature.","Refrigerate cheesecake overnight or at least 8 hours, before serving.","To remove cheesecake from pan, remove foil and gently blot off any excess condensation from the top of the cheesecake, using a paper towel.","Use a knife to run around the edges of the pan and gently push the bottom of the cheesecake pan up to lift it out of the pan (or unhinge the buckle if your pan has that).","For the homemade whipped cream, in a bowl, add heavy whipping cream with powdered sugar.","Beat until peaks form, this will take several minutes.","Using a disposable decorator bag, pipe swirls of whipped cream on cheesecake. Or place in a bowl and serve with a spoon so guests can add their own whipped cream."]
