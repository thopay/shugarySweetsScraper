serves: 60
time: "4 hours 19 minutes"
prepTime: "15 minutes"
instructions: ["In a large saucepan, combine sugar, milk, vanilla, butter and espresso powder.","Bring to a boil over medium high heat, stirring constantly.","Once boiling, keep at a rolling boil for two full minutes (still stirring).","For this next step, I use a stand mixer with whisk attachment, but a hand mixer would work too.","In a large bowl, combine marshmallows and chocolate.","Pour hot mixture over these ingredients and blend until smooth. I turn my mixer on medium speed and allow it to blend for about 2-3 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl several times.","While this is mixing, place your caramel and heavy cream in a microwave safe bowl and heat for 1-2 minutes, stirring every 30 seconds until melted and smooth. Set aside.","Pour the creamy fudge mixture into a parchment paper lined 15inch x 10inch x 1inch baking sheet. Drizzle with hot caramel, using a knife to swirl it into the fudge.","Sprinkle immediately with kosher salt (or coarse sea salt).","Let set for 4 hours, or overnight.","Cut into small bites and store for up to two weeks. ENJOY!"]
