instructions: ["For the donuts, mix flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Add in eggs, milk, vanilla and butter. Beat for 2-3 minutes.","Spray mini muffin pan with baking spray. Fill each muffin cup about 1/2 full and bake in a 325 degree oven for about 7-9 minutes.","Remove and cool in pan about 10 minutes, then cool completely on wire rack.","For the glaze, whisk together the powdered sugar and milk until smooth. Dip each donut hole top into the glaze and place on parchment paper. Repeat until all donut holes are dipped. Glaze will run down the sides, so there is no need to dip entire thing (unless you want to of course). Allow to set, about 10 minutes. ENJOY."]
