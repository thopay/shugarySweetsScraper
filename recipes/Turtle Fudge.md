ingredients: ["4 cups granulated sugar","1 cup milk","1 cup unsalted butter","25 marshmallows","1 package (11.5 ounces) milk chocolate chips","1 package (12 ounces) semisweet chocolate chips","2 ounces unsweetened chocolate","1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract","1 package (11 ounce) caramel bits, or about 2 cups caramels","2 tablespoons heavy cream","2 1/2 cups pecan halves, chopped"]
serves: 120
time: "3 hours 27 minutes"
prepTime: "15 minutes"
instructions: ["In a large saucepan, combine sugar, milk, and butter.","Bring to a boil over medium high heat, stirring constantly.","Once boiling, keep at a rolling boil for two full minutes (still stirring).","For this next step, I use a stand mixer with whisk attachment, but a hand mixer would work too.","In a large bowl, combine marshmallows and chocolates, and vanilla extract.","Pour hot mixture over these ingredients and blend until smooth. I turn my mixer on medium speed and allow it to blend for about 2-3 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl several times.","While this is mixing, place your caramel and heavy cream in a microwave safe bowl and heat for 1-2 minutes, stirring every 30 seconds until melted and smooth. Set aside.","Once the chocolate fudge mixture is smooth, and all the marshmallows are melted, fold in the pecan halves. Pour the fudge mixture into a parchment paper lined 15inch x 10inch x 1inch baking sheet. Drizzle with hot caramel, using a knife to swirl it into the fudge.","Refrigerate for 3 hours, or overnight.","Cut into small bites and enjoy, or keep in large pieces in a ziploc bag (uncut) for up to two weeks!"]
