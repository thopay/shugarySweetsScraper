Stir in flour and baking powder.","On a lightly floured surface, turn out the dough and roll to about 1/4-1/2-inch thickness.","Using a lid from a mason jar, or a 3-inch circle cookie cutter, cut out circles and place on cookie sheet.","Bake cookies for 7-9 mninutes, until bottoms are lightly golden. Cool on wire rack completely before decorating.","Frost cookies with vanilla frosting (just a thin layer, you won't use all of it yet).
