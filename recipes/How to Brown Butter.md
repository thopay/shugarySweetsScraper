instructions: ["In a small saucepan or skillet, add butter and melt over low heat.","Once the butter has melted, increase the heat to medium. Continue heating for about five minutes, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula. The butter will start to foam at this point.","With the rubber spatula, move the foam aside to monitor the brown flecks on the bottom of the pan. The butter will begin to smell nutty and develop into a golden-brown color.","Continue to heat until desired level of browning is achieved. At this stage, close monitoring of the butter is very important. The butter can go quickly from browned to burnt, depending on the heat level.","When done browning, immediately pour the browned butter into a heatproof bowl to cool.Â Do not cool in the pan as it will continue to brown."]
