prepTime: "30 minutes"
instructions: ["In a large mixing bowl, beat cream cheese and butter with sugars until smooth and creamy. Beat in a flour, vanilla, salt, cinnamon and cream of tartar. Scoop by small tablespoon (I use a 1 Tbsp scoop) onto a parchment paper lined freezer safe baking sheet. Scoop all the dough into balls. Freeze for 2 hours (or overnight).","Melt white chocolate wafers. Remove about 1/4 cup and reserve for later. To remaining melted white chocolate, add 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon. Using a toothpick, dip each frozen truffle into melted white chocolate, tapping side of bowl gently to remove excess. Repeat until all truffles have been dipped. Using remaining 1/4 cup white chocolate, pour into a ziploc sandwich bag.","Snip off end and drizzle over coated truffles. Sprinkle immediately with cinnamon/sugar mixture. Allow to set, about 15 minutes. Store truffles in refrigerator for one week, or freezer for one month."]
