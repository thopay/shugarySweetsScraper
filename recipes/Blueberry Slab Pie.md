ingredients: ["3 refrigerated ready-made pie crusts","5 cups fresh blueberries","¾ cup granulated sugar","4 Tablespoons cornstarch","½ teaspoon cinnamon","¼ teaspoon kosher salt","1 Tablespoon fresh lemon juice","1/4 cup all-purpose flour (for work surface)","1 large egg white, beaten","1 large egg, beaten","Coarse sanding sugar (optional)"]
serves: 12
time: "2 hours 10 minutes"
prepTime: "20 minutes"
instructions: ["Preheat the oven to 425℉. Move the oven rack to the lower third of the oven.","Take the refrigerated pie crusts out of the refrigerator, but keep them in the plastic sleeve. Set aside.","Add blueberries, sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, salt, and lemon juice to a large mixing bowl. Fold the ingredients together carefully to not crush the blueberries. Set aside.","Lightly flour a work surface. Unroll two thawed pie crusts and stack them on top of each other.","Using a large rolling pin, roll the dough to about a 17”x14” rectangle.","Transfer the dough to a quarter sheet pan and press the crust into the corners of the pan, allowing the excess dough to hang over the edges.","Brush the flat part of the crust with egg white.","Pour the blueberry filling into the prepared pan and spread it out in an even layer. Set aside.","Roll out the third crust until it is about 12-inches in diameter. Using a pastry cutter, pizza wheel, or knife, cut 14 strips that are about ½-inch wide. ","Begin laying 7 strips of pie crust across the pan, starting with the longest strip of dough and placing it diagonally, from corner to corner. The strips should be overlapping or almost touching the edges of the pan. ","Fold back every other strip of dough and begin laying the other pieces diagonally across the pan in the other direction, from corner to corner. Repeat this with all the strips to form the lattice design.","Roll the crust edges toward the center of the pan forming an even edge and concealing all the ends of the pie crust strips.","Brush the crust with beaten egg and sprinkle with sanding sugar.","Bake for about 30 minutes. Then, loosely place a piece of foil on the pie to prevent the crust from over-browning, and bake for an additional 20 minutes or until the crust is browned and the blueberry filling is bubbly.","Serve warm or at room temperature."]
