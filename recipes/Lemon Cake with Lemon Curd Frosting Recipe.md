instructions: ["To prepare cake, grease and flour two 9-inch cake pans and line bottoms with parchment paper (cut circles to fit). Set aside.","In a small bowl, beat egg whites, 1/4 cup of the buttermilk and lemon zest. Set aside.","In mixing bowl, beat butter and sugar until creamy, about 2-3 minutes. Add in dry ingredients and mix until combined. Slowly add in egg white mixture. Beat in remaining buttermilk.","Pour evenly into cake pans. Bake in a 350 degree oven for about 25-28 minutes, until toothpick comes out clean. Remove and cool in cake pans 5 minutes. Invert onto a wire rack and cool completely before frosting.","For the frosting, beat butter for 3-5 minutes until pale in color. Add powdered sugar, lemon zest and lemon juice (about 2 Tbsp from fresh lemon). Don’t add the heavy cream yet. Beat for 3-5 minutes until fluffy. Remove 1 cup of this frosting mixture. Set aside for now.","To the big bowl of frosting add 2 Tablespoons of heavy cream and beat an additional 2-3 minutes until light and fluffy.","To make the filling, take that 1 cup of the frosting and add ¼ cup of lemon curd and beat until combined.","To assemble, place the first layer of the cake on a server or cake platter. Gently tuck strips of parchment paper under the cake to keep the frosting off your serving dish. ","Spread the lemon curd frosting over the top of the cake.","Place the second cake layer on top of the filling and press down slightly to secure.","Spread the remaining frosting over the sides and the top of the cake. Remove parchment paper slips. Enjoy."]
