ingredients: ["2 large egg whites ","1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar (optional, see notes) ","¼ cup granulated sugar ","1 ¼ cups powdered sugar ","¾ cup super fine almond flour ","Gel Food Coloring, (optional, see notes) ","1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened ","2 1/4 cups powdered sugar ","¼ cup lemon curd, divided ","1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract ","½ teaspoon lemon zest"]
serves: 24
time: "54 minutes"
prepTime: "15 minutes"
instructions: ["Line two sheet pans with parchment paper or silpat mats.","Add the egg whites to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Beat the egg whites on medium-high speed until they become foamy-- about 30 seconds. If using cream of tartar, add it now.","With the mixer on medium speed, add the sugar slowly allowing it to fully incorporate before adding the next batch. It should take 2-3 minutes to add all of the sugar.","Once all of the sugar has been added, let the mixer run until the egg whites reach stiff peaks-- about 2-3 more minutes.","Use a fine mesh sieve to sift the powdered sugar and almond flour into the egg whites.","Fold the dry ingredients gently into the egg whites by making a J shape with a rubber spatula.","Once all of the dry ingredients have been incorporated, add gel food coloring, if using.","Next, smush the batter against the sides of the bowl and fold it back together 4-5 times before testing if the meringue is at the figure 8 stage.","The macarons are ready to pipe when you can draw an 8 with the meringue without the steam breaking. If the meringuefalls off in clumps, smush it a few more times before testing for the figure 8 again.","When the mixture flows smoothly, transfer it to a piping bag fitted with a round tip (I like a Wilton #10-12).","Pipe 1.5” circles about 2” apart. Hold the tray 6” off the counter and drop it straight down onto the counter. Repeat 4-5 times, or until it looks like all of the air bubbles have popped.","Set the macarons aside to rest for 25-30 minutes, or until they have developed a skin. When you touch them lightly, they shouldn’t stick to your finger. While the macarons rest, preheat your oven to 325F.","Bake the macarons one tray at a time for 14 minutes, turning the pan half way through baking. Allow the macarons to cool fully on the tray to avoid sticking.","Add the butter to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat on medium-high speed for 2-3 minutes, or until it’s light and airy. Make sure to scrape the sides of the bowl down a few times while it mixes.","With the mixer on low speed, gradually add the powdered sugar. When the powdered sugar is all incorporated, add two tablespoons of lemon curd, the vanilla extract, and the lemon zest.","Turn the mixer to high speed and beat until the icing is light and fluffy-- about 3-4 minutes. Transfer to a piping bag (fitted with your choice of tip) and set aside until ready to use.","Place the macarons in similar sized pairs. Pipe a ring of lemon buttercream around the edge of one macaron shell. Fill the center with lemon curd and then place another macaron shell on top. Press gently to seal them together. Repeat with the remaining macarons.","Place the filled macarons in the fridge to age overnight. Bring them to room temperature and enjoy. Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to three days."]
