serves: 4
time: "15 minutes"
prepTime: "5 minutes"
instructions: ["Place your chicken breasts into a ziploc bag, and pound them to about 1/4-1/2 inch thick using a meat tenderizer. Alternately, you can slice then in half lengthwise, making thin cutlets.","Warm a large skillet over medium high heat. Add the olive oil and heat until warm. Add the chicken in a single layer and sprinkle with half of the salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. Cook without touching for about two minutes, you'll notice the edges of the chicken cooking, while only the center is pink. Flip the chicken over and sprinkle with the remaining salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. Top each piece of chicken with cheese and then tomato slices. Cover with a lid and cook an additional 3-4 minutes.","Check the chicken for doneness. I use this meat thermometer, and the temperature should read 165Â°F.","Sprinkle with fresh basil and drizzle with the balsamic vinegar right before serving. ENJOY!"]
