instructions: ["For the crust layer, pulse cookies in a food processor until fine crumbs. Or use a ziploc bag and crush with a rolling pin!","Add melted butter to the cookie crumbs and pour into the bottom of a 13x9 baking dish.","Using the palm of your hand or the bottom of a cup, firmly press the crumbs into the bottom of the dish. Set aside.","In a large bowl, beat softened cream cheese, peanut butter, and powdered sugar until smooth and creamy. Fold Cool Whip in cream cheese mixture until blended.","Pour over crust. Using an offset spatula, spread the mixture evenly over the crust layer.","In a large bowl add two packages of INSTANT chocolate pudding mix. Make sure you purchase the instant variety or this won't set up properly.","Whisk in milk. You'll use less milk than the box says because you want this layer extra thick and fudgy.","Once the pudding mix is well blended, spread the pudding over cheesecake layer.","Add remaining Cool Whip to the top of the peanut butter lasagna. Sprinkle with more mini chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, and mini peanut butter cups. Refrigerate for 3 hours or overnight.","Slice and serve. Store in refrigerator for up to 5 days. ENJOY."]
