ingredients: ["18 Oreo cookies","3 Tablespoons unsalted butter, melted","2 packages (8 ounce each) cream cheese, room temperature","1/2 cup granulated sugar","1/2 cup sour cream","2 Tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder","2 large eggs","4 ounce Ghirardelli 60% cacao chocolate bar, melted","1 teaspoon vanilla extract","1/2 cup heavy whipping cream","4 ounce Ghirardelli 60% cacao chocolate bar"]
serves: 8
time: "6 hours 55 minutes"
prepTime: "20 minutes"
instructions: ["In a food processor, pulse oreo cookies until fine crumb. Add in melted butter.","Press crumbs firmly into the bottom, and slightly up the sides, of a 7-inch springform pan.","Place in freezer while you make the filling.","In a large mixing bowl, beat cream cheese with sugar until creamy. Add in sour cream and beat just until combined.","Add in cocoa powder, melted chocolate, eggs, and vanilla and mix by hand until everything is incorporated.","Pour into prepared crust. Cover the top of the cheesecake pan with foil. Then take a second long piece of foil and cover the bottom of the pan and up the sides.","Pour 1 cup of water into the bottom of the pressure cooker. Place the cheesecake pan on a trivet or sling and lower into the Instant Pot.","Lock the lid in place and make sure the valve on top is set to \"SEALING.\"","Select HIGH PRESSURE and a cook time of 35 minutes. (timer will begin after it comes to pressure)","Once the time ends, allow to naturally release. This means do not touch the valve until the silver pin drops. This will take anywhere from 20-30 minutes.","Once the pressure is released, open the lid, and remove the cheesecake using the sling. Allow to cool to room temperature on the counter. I leave the foil in place.","Once room temperature, place cheesecake in the refrigerator for 6 hours, or overnight (with the foil still one...you can dab the excess moisture off the top of the foil if needed).","Heat heavy cream in microwave for 45 seconds. Add chocolate (broken into pieces).","Stir until smooth (this may take a few minutes). Allow to cool slightly before pouring over the top of chilled cheesecake.","Remove foil from cheesecake and slide a butter knife around the edge of the pan. Release the spring and remove pan.","Pour ganache over the top and allow to set (if desired).","Slice and serve with homemade whipped cream."]
