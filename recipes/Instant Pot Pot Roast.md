Remove roast to a plate. Set aside.","Add onion to the pot and continue to saute for about 3 minutes, until softened, scraping up the bits of browned meat from the bottom of the pan. ","Stir in beef broth, tomato paste, and worcestershire sauce. To the top of the roast, spread dijon mustard and onion soup mix. Using a fork make a paste. Add roast to the pressure cooker.","Lock the lid in place, select high pressure, and cook for 75 minutes.","Once the cook time ends, allow the pressure cooker to naturally release pressure for 15 minutes, then do a quick release. When the valve drops, open the lid and remove the roast to a cutting board, cover with foil.","Add your carrots and potatoes to the pressure cooker liquid that remains in the Instant Pot. Secure the lid and cook on high pressure for 3 minutes. ","When the time ends, use a quick release and remove vegetables to serving platter.","In a small bowl, whisk cornstarch with water. Turn pressure cooker to saute and whisk in the cornstarch mixture. Bring to a boil, while continuously whisking the gravy.","This will take about 3-5 minutes for the gravy to boil and thicken to desired thickness. Turn off pressure cooker.","To serve, shred pot roast with fork and serve with vegetables and gravy. Garnish with fresh parsley. ENJOY."]
