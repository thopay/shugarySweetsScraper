instructions: ["If you haven't baked the sweet potatoes go ahead and do that now. You can bake at 400° for about 1 hour or use my Instant Pot Sweet Potato recipe.","Hard boil the eggs. I like mine a bit of the soft side so I cook them in boiling water for 7 minutes. Or use my Instant Pot Hard Boiled Eggs recipe.","To bake the salmon, simply season with salt, pepper, and a drizzle of olive oil. Roast at 450° for about 12 minutes for medium.","Make the dressing by whisking together the egg, lemon, anchovy, garlic, vinegar, and Dijon mustard. Stream in the olive oil while whisking until it thickens. Season with salt and pepper to taste.","To assemble, simply toss the lettuce with the dressing, salmon, and avocado. Cut open the sweet potato and stuff with the salad. Top with an egg!"]
