instructions: ["Preheat oven to 400° F. You will need a 10 x 2-inch deep pie dish or cast iron skillet.","In a large pan, heat olive oil and add the cubed chicken, sausage, onion, and garlic.","Cook on medium-high heat until the chicken is browned on all sides (does not need to be fully cooked). Remove chicken and place in a large bowl. Set aside.","Place the large pan back on low heat to melt the butter.","Add the flour and whisk with the melted butter for about 3-4 minutes.","Turn the heat up to medium and slowly add the chicken stock, whisking the entire time you add it.","Slowly add in the heavy cream and bring to a simmer, still whisking.","Add the thyme, cayenne, creole, and onion powder seasonings and whisk for about 4-5 more minutes turning down the heat if it starts to bubble too much.","Stir in the diced green peppers and tomato and then add the meat mixture that was set aside at the beginning.","Transfer everything to your pie dish (or cast iron skillet) and spread it out evenly.","Unfold your thawed puff pastry and lay it over the top of the filling. Carefully tuck the edges in around the dish.","Using a pastry brush, glaze the puff pastry with the beaten egg.","Place the pot pie into the oven and bake for about 40 minutes until the pastry turns a golden brown and the filling starts to bubble around the edges of the pie dish. Sprinkle with a little fresh thyme. Serve immediately!"]
