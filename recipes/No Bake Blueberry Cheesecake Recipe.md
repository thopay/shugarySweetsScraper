serves: 10
time: "3 hours 15 minutes"
prepTime: "15 minutes"
instructions: ["Lightly grease the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan with baking spray. Set this aside.","In a food processor, you're going to blend the almond slices with graham crackers, and granulated sugar. Process this until fine crumbs.","Slowly add in melted butter and mix until crumbly. Pour crust mixture into the bottom of prepared springform pan.","Press crumbs firmly to create crust, allowing them to go up slightly on the sides of the pan. Set aside.","In a large mixing bowl, beat cream cheese with sugar for several minutes, until light and fluffy, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. ","Add in heavy whipping cream and almond extract and beat for an additional 2-3 minutes. Pour cheesecake filling onto prepared crust.","Carefully spoon one can of thick, blueberry pie filling onto the top of the cheesecake layer. I used the entire can, but if you want a little less, feel free to not use it all (and save the blueberry pie filling to go on top of some ice cream later!","Top the entire cheesecake with whipped topping (or homemade whipped cream). I reserved some of it and spooned it into a piping bag to put some swirls on top (totally optional). Sprinkle the top of the cake with more sliced almonds. ","Refrigerate entire cake for at least 3 hours (or overnight). When ready to serve, release springform pan, cut slices of cheesecake into wedges and enjoy."]
