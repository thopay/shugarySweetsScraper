serves: 36
time: "1 hour 30 minutes"
prepTime: "1 hour"
instructions: ["In a food processor, pulse pecans and cookies until fine crumbs. Pour into a large bowl. Add brown sugar, corn syrup and vanilla extract. Mix with a spoon until fully combined.","Using a one tablespoon scoop, drop scoops onto a parchment paper lined baking sheet (that is freezer safe). Once all scoops have been formed, roll each scoop into a nice smooth ball with your hands. Transfer baking sheet to freezer for about 30 minutes.","When ready, melt white chocolate and dark chocolate wafers in separate bowls according to package directions.","Using a toothpick, dip cold truffle into either vanilla or chocolate. Tap on side of bowl to remove excess. Place back on parchment paper, remove toothpick and top with a pecan halve (to cover the toothpick hole). Repeat until all truffles are dipped.","I like to work in two stages. It's easier if the truffles remain very cold. So I do half of them while the other half is still in the freezer. Then I work on the second half.Store truffles in an air tight container for up to 10 days. I like them best served cold, but room temperature is delicious too!"]
