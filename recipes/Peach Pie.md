serves: 8
time: "1 hour 15 minutes"
prepTime: "20 minutes"
instructions: ["Preheat the oven to 400℉. Move the oven rack to a position in the lower third of the oven.","Place peaches in a colander. Pour lemon juice over the top and toss to distribute. Let excess juice drain.","Place peaches, granulated sugar, and brown sugar in a large mixing bowl and toss to combine. Let sit for 15 minutes.","On a lightly floured surface, roll out one pie crust and fit it into a 9-inch pie plate with about an inch overhang.","Drain most of the juices in the bowl. Add cinnamon, nutmeg, and cornstarch. Toss to combine. Pour the mixture into the prepared pie crust.","Dot the top of the peach filling with thin slices of butter.","Roll out the second pie crust. Using a pastry cutter, pizza cutter, or knife, cut eight 1-inch strips. ","Lay four strips vertically across the pie plate, letting the strips overlap the edges. Lay four strips horizontally, weaving in a traditional lattice top or placing them over the vertical strips making a second layer. Roll the edges toward the center of the pie, tucking in the ends of the lattice strips. Crimp or flute the edge of the crust as desired.","Combine the water and egg white in a small bowl to make an egg wash. Brush the crust with the egg wash and sprinkle with cinnamon and granulated sugar.","Bake pie for 15 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 375℉ and bake an additional 35-40 minutes or until the filling is bubbling and the crust is golden brown. Cover with foil to prevent the crust from getting too brown.","Cool for 3-4 hours. The pie will set up as it cools. It can be served warm."]
