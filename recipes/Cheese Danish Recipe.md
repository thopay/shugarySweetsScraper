ingredients: ["1 box (17 ounce) frozen puff pastry sheets","1 package (8 ounce) cream cheese, softened to room temperature","1/2 cup granulated sugar","1 teaspoon vanilla extract","1 egg, separated","1 teaspoon water","1 cup powdered sugar","1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract","2 Tablespoons milk","2 Tablespoons powdered sugar, for garnish"]
serves: 8
time: "30 minutes"
prepTime: "15 minutes"
instructions: ["Thaw puff pastry according to package directions. Mine took about 15 minutes at room temperature.","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Set aside.","Cut each sheet of puff pastry into fourths, resulting in 8 large squares. Set aside.","In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese with granulated sugar, vanilla extract, and egg yolk (save the egg white).","Beat until fully combined and smooth. Spoon about 2 Tablespoons of filling into the center of each square of puff pastry.","Using a sharp knife cut the pastry from each corner towards the center, just until you get to the filling. You will now have four *almost* triangles cut. Take the left edge of the triangle and bring it up over the filling. Repeat for all four triangles. The shape will resemble a pinwheel (see my photos in the blog post for a visual tutorial).","In a small bowl, whisk the remaining egg white with water. Brush over the tops of the puff pastry.","Bake in preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, until pastry is lightly browned.","While danish is baking, whisk together the powdered sugar, vanilla extract, and milk for the icing. Whisk until smooth.","Remove danishes from oven and drizzle with icing. Dust with powdered sugar right before serving. Serve within several hours for best flavor and texture!"]
