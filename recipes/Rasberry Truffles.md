ingredients: ["1.6 ounce package freeze dried raspberries (about 2 cups)","1 package (14 ounce) white chocolate chips or bars","2 Tablespoons unsalted butter","3/4 cup heavy whipping cream","1 package (14 ounce) dark chocolate (bittersweet chocolate)"]
serves: 25
time: "3 hours 31 minutes"
prepTime: "30 minutes"
instructions: ["Add raspberries to a food processor and pulse until fine powder. Set aside.","In a large glass bowl, add white chocolate with butter. Set aside.","In a small saucepan, heat heavy cream over low. Simmer, but do not boil. When warm, pour over the white chocolate and butter. Allow to sit for 5 minutes.","After 5 minutes, use a spatula to stir the white chocolate until smooth and combined.","Add 1/2 cup of the freeze dried raspberry powder, stir in. Taste for flavor. If not strong enough, add another 1-2 Tablespoons of powder. We found that 1/2 cup was plenty, for color and flavor. Save the remaining powder to sprinkle on top of the truffles in step 10.","Place plastic wrap over the bowl and chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours.","Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.","Using a small 1 Tablespoon cookie scoop, scoop mixture and roll in ball, place on parchment paper. Repeat with remaining mixture (you'll get about 25 truffles). Put the tray of truffles back in the refrierator (or freezer) for 30 minutes).","Melt dark chocolate according to package directions (use a double boiler method for best results).","Remove truffles for freezer/refrigerator. Using a fork (or toothpick), dip in melted chocolate, tap on side of bowl to remove the excess, then place back on parchment paper. Sprinkle with a pinch of the remaining raspberry powder."]
