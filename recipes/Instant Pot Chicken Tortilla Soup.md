instructions: ["In a 6 qt Instant Pot, add olive oil to pot and turn on \"SAUTE\" function. When hot, add in the onion, jalapeno, and garlic, cooking for about 2 minutes, until onions are translucent in color.","Add chicken tenderloins and continue the saute function for about 2 minutes on each side.","Deglaze the pot by adding in the chicken broth. Scrape the bits on the bottom of the pot completely so nothing is sticking. Turn Instant Pot off.","Add in cumin, chili powder, Rotel tomatoes (don't drain), black beans, and corn (don't drain). Stir gently. Top with tortilla strips (do not stir at this point).","Secure the lid in place and select \"SEALING\" with the valve on top.","Select HIGH PRESSURE for a cook time of 7 minutes. When cook time ends, allow to naturally release pressure for ten minutes. Do a quick release of remaining pressure by moving the valve on top to \"VENTING.\"","Open the lid and shred the chicken with two forks (or remove to a cutting board and shred it). Squeeze one lime into the pot and serve.","Top soup with crunchy tortilla strips, cilantro, avocado, sour cream, and cheese. ENJOY."]
