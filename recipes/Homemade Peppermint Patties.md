Using about 1 Tbsp of filling, shape into a ball, then flatten it for the traditional shape. If wanting to make footballs, shape into a ball and then pinch the ends. Continue until all filling is used. Cover with saran wrap and freeze for about 2 hours (or overnight).","Melt Ghirardelli chocolate wafers according to package directions. Using a toothpick, dip frozen peppermints into the chocolate. Tap until all the excess has dripped off and place back on the parchment paper. Repeat until all peppermints have been coated. These should be set within minutes, because you are doing them while still cold.","Store at room temperature in a covered container!","If making footballs, melt white chocolate according to package directions. Pour into a small ziploc bag and cut the corner off. Pipe laces onto footballs. Sets within minutes! ENJOY!"]
