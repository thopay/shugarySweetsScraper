instructions: ["In a small bowl, melt chocolate according to the package instructions.  Place an oreo flat on a fork and dip it into the chocolate.  Using a second fork, turn it over to make sure the whole Oreo gets covered with chocolate.  Using the bottom fork, lift the Oreo out of the chocolate and gently tap the fork on the edge of the bowl to remove any excess chocolate. ","Place the Oreo onto a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.","If you are planning to decorate the Oreo with sprinkles or holiday decorations without adding drizzle to the top of the Oreo, you’ll want to decorate immediately before the chocolate hardens.  ","If you would like to drizzle the Oreo with melted chocolate, let the first layer of chocolate set for about 30 minutes before doing so.  Melt the additional chocolate and drizzle using a fork or spoon.  You can also put sprinkles or decorations on top of the drizzle.","Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks."]
