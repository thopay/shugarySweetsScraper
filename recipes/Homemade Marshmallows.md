serves: 48
time: "4 hours 25 minutes"
prepTime: "2 minutes"
instructions: ["Grease a 9”x13” baking dish and dust with powdered sugar. Grease a spatula and handle. Set aside.","In the bowl of a mixer, add unflavored gelatine and ½ cup of cold water. Stir to combine. Set aside.","In a medium saucepan, add sugar, corn syrup, remaining 1/2 cup water, and kosher salt. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring until the sugar is dissolved.","Increase the heat to high and bring the mixture to 240℉, using a digital or candy thermometer to monitor. This process will take about 10 minutes.","Once the syrup reaches temperature, remove from heat.","With the mixer on low speed, using the whisk attachment, slowly add the syrup to the gelatine and water mixture. ","Once all the syrup has been added, turn the mixer up to high speed and let it whisk the mixture until it’s light and fluffy. This process can take about 10-12 minutes. ","During the last minute of whisking, turn the mixer speed down to medium low, and add the vanilla. Then return the mixer speed to high.","Pour the marshmallow mixture into the prepared dish. Using the greased spatula, scrape the sides of the mixing bowl to get all the marshmallow fluff. Use the spatula to spread the marshmallow fluff into an even layer.","Using wet fingertips, smooth out the top layer of marshmallow.","Sprinkle the top of the marshmallow with powdered sugar and let dry, uncovered, for 4 hours or up to overnight.","With a knife dipped into water, cut into 1” squares.","Place cut marshmallows in a bowl with powdered sugar. Toss to coat."]
