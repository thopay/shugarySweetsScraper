Scrape the bottom of the pot with the wooden spoon to get any browned bits that stick to the pan, this will prevent the \"burn\" notice.","Lock the lid and turn the pressure release valve to \"SEALING.\" Select \"HIGH PRESSURE\" with a cook time of 4 minutes.","While the sausage is pressure cooking, combine milk and flour in a bowl, whisking it together.","When the cook time ends, do a quick release by moving the pressure cooker valve on top to \"VENTING.\" Open the lid.","Turn Instant Pot back on \"SAUTE.\" Add in the milk mixture and the salt and pepper. Stir until sausage gravy is thick and bubbly, this will take several minutes. Serve over cooked biscuits. ENJOY!"]
