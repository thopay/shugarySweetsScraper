Beat at medium speed, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed, for at least 2-3 min or until the mixture is creamy.    ","Add in the eggs and beat until blended into the cookie dough.    ","Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture in batches and mix just until the dough is formed.     ","Flatten the dough to form a large disc, wrap it with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least an hour.     ","Once chilled, roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to 1/4-inch thickness and cut out pumpkinshapes using a pumpkin cookie cutter.    ","Transfer the cut-out cookies carefully to the prepared baking tray and then use a sharp knife to carve out eyes and mouths as you like in half of the cookies (or use a cookie cutter that has the face shapes).","Roll the leftover dough and repeat the process.    ","Bake in a preheated oven for 11-13 minutes or until they begin to turn golden-brown.","Let the cookies cool for 5 minutes on the cookie sheet before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.    ","Combine cinnamon with sugar for the topping. Brush melted butter on top of the cooled cookies and then sprinkle cinnamon sugar on top.   ","Assembling - Apply a layer of the melted chocolate on the base cookie and then place the carved-out cookie on top.
