prepTime: "15 minutes"
instructions: ["Choose your dish. I used a 9.25-inch pie plate made for deep dish pies! You could also use a square or round baking dish, a large platter, or a bowl. You decide!","Layer 1: Blend cream cheese, 1 cup sour cream and 1 package taco seasoning until smooth. Spread in bottom of pie plate.","Layer 2: Meat or Beans. Brown your ground beef in a medium skillet over high heat until all the pink is out. Drain meat and add 1 package taco seasoning (no water needed). Spread meat over the first layer. If you prefer, use a can of refried beans instead of meat.","Layer 3: Spread diced green chilies over meat layer (no need to drain).","Layer 4: Salsa. Use a thick and chunky salsa and spread over green chilies.","Layer 5: Shredded cheese. Add about 1 cup of shredded cheese sprinkled over the top of the salsa.","Layer 6: Guacamole. Spread 1 cup of either homemade guacamole or already prepared guacamole over the salsa.","Layer 7: Sour Cream. Spread 1 cup of sour cream over the top of the guacamole. If making the spider web, skip spreading it, and instead put the cup of sour cream in a ziploc bag. Snip off the corners and pipe over the top of the guacamole. Start by making the lines, then connect them to create a web.","Add the finishing touch by sprinkling the diced tomato, green onion, remaining 1/4 cup of shredded cheese, and black olives to the edges of the pan. (If not making the web, you can sprinkle this all over the top of the sour cream instead).","Add some fake spiders and serve with tortilla chips! ENJOY!"]
