instructions: ["Start by making two graham cracker crusts, or do what I did and purchase them already made.","Normally I would make my own using THIS recipe, however, with holiday chaos I chose to purchase the already made crusts.","If making your own, pulse 18 full size graham crackers with 1/2 cup granulated sugar in a food processor until fine crumbs. Add melted butter and stir with a fork.","Press crumbs into the bottom of two pie plates, using the back of your hand or bottom of a cup to press firmly. Set aside.","For the filling, I used homemade whipped cream instead of Cool Whip. I have nothing against using Whipped Topping, but I forgot to buy it when I was setting out to make this recipe for the blog.","Plus, so many of you ask me anyway if you can use homemade whipped cream. ","In a large mixing bowl, beat heavy whipping cream until stiff peaks form. This will take several minutes. Set aside.","In mixing bowl, combine softened cream cheese with pistachio pudding mix. Beat until light and fluffy. Add in crushed pineapples. Do not drain.","Mix until combined. Fold in marshmallow and homemade whipped cream until blended.","Spoon into pie crust and chill for several hours or overnight. ","When ready to serve, make homemade sweetened whipped cream by beating 1/2 cup heavy cream in mixing bowl until stiff peaks form. Beat in powdered sugar. Pipe onto pie or spread thin layer over top. Add some cherries. You can even add chopped pistachios if you'd like.","Keep refrigerated until ready to use, store covered."]
