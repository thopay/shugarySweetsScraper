ingredients: ["1 ½ cups all-purpose flour","1 Tablespoon granulated sugar","2 teaspoons baking powder","½ teaspoon kosher salt","1 teaspoon cinnamon","⅛ teaspoon apple pie spice","⅔ cup milk","2 large eggs, beaten","1 teaspoon vanilla extract","3 cups finely diced apple (about 3-4 apples peeled and cored)","Vegetable oil for frying*","1 cup powdered sugar","½ teaspoon vanilla extract","2 Tablespoons milk"]
serves: 12
time: "19 minutes"
prepTime: "15 minutes"
instructions: ["Add 1 ½ to 2 inches of vegetable oil to a large skillet or saucepan and heat on medium high heat to 350℉.  ","While the oil is heating, make the fritter batter. Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and apple pie spice in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the milk, eggs and vanilla.","Fold in the apples and stir until just combined.","When the oil has reached 350℉, it’s ready. Using 2 spoons, add about 1/4 cup of fritter batter to the oil. The two spoons will help make a fritter that is a little flatter, making it easier to evenly cook the fritter. Fry each side about 2 minutes before turning them over to brown the other side. Continue to check the oil temperature throughout the cooking time with the thermometer.","Check the doneness of the fritter by inserting a sharp knife into the middle. If the knife comes out clean, they are done. Use a slotted spoon to remove the fritters and transfer them to a paper towel to drain.  ","In a small mixing bowl, whisk powdered sugar, milk and vanilla until smooth. Drizzle over warm fritters."]
