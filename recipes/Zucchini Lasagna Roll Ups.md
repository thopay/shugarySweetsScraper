serves: 6
time: "1 hour 15 minutes"
prepTime: "30 minutes"
instructions: ["Preheat oven to 375°.  Spread about ¼ cup of marinara sauce in the bottom of a 10” x 7” casserole dish or similar size.  Set aside.","Cut zucchini lengthwise into ¼” thick slices.  A mandolin slicer can be used.  This method tends to produce slices that are a little thinner than cutting them with a knife. ","Place the zucchini in a single layer on a stove top griddle, in a frying pan, or even on an outdoor grill.  Cook for about 2 minutes on each side or until the zucchini becomes soft.  This also helps remove some of the moisture in the zucchini.  Transfer the slices to a plate.","While zucchini is cooling, combine all ingredients for filling.","Lay zucchini slices out and spoon about 1 tablespoon of ricotta filling on each slice, spreading the filling the length of the slice into an even layer. ","Roll up each slice and place the roll, seam side down, into the casserole dish in a single layer.","Top zucchini rolls with additional marinara sauce and shredded mozzarella cheese.","Bake for 20-25 minutes or until cheese is melted. Add salt and pepper, to taste, if desired. ENJOY."]
