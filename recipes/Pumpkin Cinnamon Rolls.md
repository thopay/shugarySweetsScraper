Add the pumpkin mixture and the egg.  Mix well.","Stir in remaining flour, ½ cup at a time.  Dough will be slightly sticky but should be able to be turned out onto a floured surface.  Knead for about 5 minutes, adding flour as necessary to keep it from sticking to your hands and the surface.","Place dough into a bowl that has been lightly oiled with non-stick spray or greased with butter. Cover with a towel, and let rise for 30 to 45 minutes or until the dough doubles in size.","Roll dought onto a well floured surface into a 12”x18” rectangle.  It should be about ½” thick.","Mix the sugar and cinnamon together in a small bowl.  Spread the softened butter over the surface of the dough, almost to the edges.  Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar mixture over the butter.","From the long edge of the rectangle, roll the dough into a log.  Pinch the seam together to seal.  Use a knife to mark off 12 equal segments.  Using a serrated knife or plain dental floss, use the guide marks to cut the rolls.","Place in the prepared pan, spiral side down.  Cover and let rise for 45 to 60 minutes or until doubled in size.","Bake rolls at in oven at 350 degrees F for 20 to 25 minutes or until tops are browned.","While the rolls are baking, make the frosting. In a small bowl, mix softened cream cheese and butter with an electric mixer until light and fluffy.  Add the powdered sugar, vanilla, maple extract and salt until combined.  ","Once the rolls have cooled slightly, frost and enjoy."]
