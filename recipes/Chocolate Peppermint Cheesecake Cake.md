instructions: ["In a small bowl, mix flour, cocoa, salt, baking soda and baking powder. Set aside.","In a measuring cup, mix together cooled coffee and milk. Set aside.","Grease 2- 9inch round baking pans and line the bottom with parchment paper. Set aside.","IN mixer, beat butter and sugar for 5 minutes, until smooth. Add eggs, one at a time. Slowly add in dry ingredients alternating with the coffee and milk mixture, about 3 additions of each.","Pour cake batter evenly into the 2 prepared pans.","Bake in a 350 degree oven for 25 minutes. Remove and cool on wire rack. When completely cooled, you can wrap each layer in plastic wrap and put in the freezer for later assembly!","Prepare the cheesecake layer. This can be done early in the day, or the night before. If freezing the cheesecake, can be stored 1-2 weeks in the freezer.","Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Using a large roasting pan, add 1 inch of water to the pan. Place it on the lowest rack of the oven! Allow it to preheat in the oven.","Prepare 9-inch springform pan by lining the bottom (inside) with a circle of parchment paper.","Beat cream cheese with granulated sugar for 2-3 minutes until creamy. Add in salt and eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.","Beat in sour cream, heavy cream, and peppermint extract, until light and fluffy (about 2 minutes). Fold in peppermint baking chips.","Pour into prepared 9-inch springform pan. Place pan in center of preheated oven, with the roasting pan of water on the lowest rack. The cake will not SIT in the water, but still get the benefit of a water bath by being in the oven with it.","Bake cheesecake for 45 minutes. Turn oven off and let cheesecake sit in oven for an additional 30 minutes. Remove and cool completely on counter.","When cooled, remove outside portion of the springform pan and place into the freezer for several hours or overnight. I put it in freezer for about 2 hours. If using within 24 hours, feel free to just refrigerate cheesecake!","beat butter for 3 minutes. Add powdered sugar and heavy cream and beat an additional 3-5 minutes until fluffy. Add baking chips.","To assemble the cake, lay one frozen layer of chocolate cake on cake plate. Top with frozen cheesecake and second layer of chocolate cake. Frost sides and top with a thin layer of frosting to apply a crumb coat. Refrigerate 30 minutes to an hour. Remove from refrigerator and frost remaining cake. I keep the cake covered in the refrigerator until ready to eat.","Remove and allow to sit about 15 minutes before slicing. ENJOY!"]
