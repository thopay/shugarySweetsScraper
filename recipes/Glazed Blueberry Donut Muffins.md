instructions: ["In a large mixing bowl, beat butter with sugar until fully combined, about 3 minutes. Add in eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition. Add in vanilla, flour, baking soda, salt, and baking powder. Add milk and combine completely. Fold in blueberries.","Scoop a large tablespoon of batter into a mini muffin pan that has been generously greased.","Bake in a 375 degree F oven for about 8-10 minutes. Remove and cool completely.","For the glaze, whisk sugar with vanilla and milk until desired consistency. I like this glaze to be a bit thinner so it is more clear once it dries.","Dip each muffin into the glaze, letting the excess glaze run down the sides of the muffin.","Allow to set, about 15-20 minutes. Store in an airtight container for up to 5 days. ENJOY!"]
