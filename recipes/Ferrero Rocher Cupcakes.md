One with a round, and one with a large star tip. I used a Wilton 1M star and 2A round tip) ","With the round tip, pipe a generous circle of frosting on top of the cupcake and gently press into the crushed hazelnuts. Knock off any access hazelnuts. ","With the star tip, pipe a swirl of frosting on top of the hazelnuts and top with a Ferrero Rocher chocolate. ","Continue with all the cupcakes. ","Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
