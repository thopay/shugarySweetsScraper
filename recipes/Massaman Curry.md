instructions: ["Peel and boil potatoes nearly done. Cut into bit size pieces. Set aside.","Pour coconut milk into measuring cup. There should be about one cup worth of watery milk, and about 2 cups worth of cream. Pour the watery milk into a small saucepan and add your bite size chicken to the pan.","Simmer until meat is fully cooked (about 10-15 minutes). If your coconut milk doesn’t separate, just put 1 cup of the cream in the pan with the chicken. It will still work fine.","In large skillet, pour remaining 2 cups of cream and red curry paste. Whisk until combined and cook on medium heat. When it reaches a boil, turn heat down to low to simmer. Pour chicken and cream into skillet.","Add bay leaves, cinnamon, worcestershire sauce, sugar, brown sugar, lime juice and garlic powder. Simmer and adjust taste as necessary by adding more curry if you want more spice, or more brown sugar if you want more sweetness. Cook for about 10 minutes.","Add in potatoes and peanuts and simmer an additional 5 minutes. Serve over Jasmine rice. Enjoy!"]
