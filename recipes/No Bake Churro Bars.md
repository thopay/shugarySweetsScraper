time: "20 minutes"
prepTime: "5 minutes"
instructions: ["Line an 8-inch square baking dish with parchment paper.","PRO TIP: Use binder clips (or mini clothespins) to secure the parchment paper to the side of the pan. This keeps the parchment paper in place.","In a large mixing bowl, add the Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal and marshmallows. Set aside.","In a medium glass bowl, add Ghirardelli white chocolate melting wafers. You can also substitute vanilla bark (Candiquik) if you’d like, but I love the taste of the Ghirardelli.","Heat melting wafers for one minute in microwave, stir and heat an additional 15-30 seconds. Stir until smooth. ","Pour over cereal and marshmallows and mix until fully coated.","Spoon mixture into baking dish, pressing down gently with the back of the spoon. Refrigerate for 15 minutes. ","Remove from pan and cut into squares. ENJOY.","Store in airtight container at room temperature. If it’s too warm, pop in refrigerator to keep the chocolate from melting."]
