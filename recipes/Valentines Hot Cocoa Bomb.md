ingredients: ["2 packages (10 oz each) Ghirardelli dark melting wafers","6 Tablespoons hot cocoa mix","1 cup mini marshmallows","6 cups hot milk","White or Additional melting wafers for decorating, as desired","Valentine’s sprinkles (optional)"]
serves: 6
time: "1 hour"
prepTime: "1 hour"
instructions: ["In a microwave safe bowl, melt chocolate wafers according to the package. Stir until smooth.","Place the silicone mold on a cookie sheet, jelly roll pan, or something that will support your mold and can be placed into the freezer.  ","Put about 1-2 Tablespoons of melted chocolate into the well of the silicone mold. Using the back of a spoon, push the chocolate up the sides until the entire mold is covered with a layer of chocolate. Start with the top of the heart, pushing a large amount of chocolate into the top curved parts and then work down to the point at the bottom.  Pay special attention to the sides making sure the chocolate completely covers the mold. You can even tilt the mold slightly as you are using the back of the spoon to coat the mold, it helps with the visibility of the mold.  ","Transfer the baking sheet to the freezer for about 10 minutes.  ","Remove the tray from the freezer and make sure there is chocolate going all the way up the side of the mold. If the chocolate layer seems thin at the edge, add a little more chocolate to thicken the edge using a spoon, small spatula or food-safe paint brush. Don’t worry about how the shell looks from the inside - it won’t be visible when the bomb is complete. Return to the freezer for 5 minutes.","Remove the mold from the freezer and flip the mold over, rounded side facing up. ","Gently press the center of each well and peel the silicone mold back from the edge of the chocolate sphere to remove the hardened chocolate. If you press too hard on the center of the mold, it can cause the shell to crack on the edges.","With the second mold, put about 1 Tablespoon of chocolate in the silicone mold so that it covers only the bottom surface.  Don’t push any chocolate up the sides. You should have enough chocolate to create a heart that is ¼” thick.  This will act as a “lid” and eventually the bottom when your heart hot cocoa bomb is assembled. (using two full size hearts results in a very large chocolate bomb, and uses way too much chocolate...this is a great fix)!","Transfer this mold to the freezer for 10 minutes.  Remove in the same manner as the first part of the shell.","Transfer all parts of the heart cocoa bomb shell to a clean surface. The shells tend to pick up any pieces of chocolate that may have hardened during the unmolding process. You don’t want those in your finished shell.","Prepare everything you’d like to add to the inside of your cocoa bomb (mix, marshmallows and anything else you’d like to add). You will have to work quickly and it’s important to have everything ready.  ","Heat a small skillet, saucepan or plate until it is warm. Place the deeper heart shell, rounded side up, on the hot surface, just until the edge begins to melt and creates an even edge for sealing the bomb. Keep your hot surface away from the other shells, as they are very heat sensitive and can begin to soften.","Place this half of the heart cocoa bomb on a cookie sheet and quickly fill with 1 Tablespoon of hot chocolate mix and 10-12 mini marshmallows.","Place the shallow heart shaped chocolate gently on the filled shell, making a “lid.” Hold it in place for a few seconds so that the melted chocolate edges will meet and act as a “glue” to hold the 2 halves together. Since the “lid” is slightly smaller than the filled heart, it won’t meet seamlessly. You just want enough melted chocolate to hold them together.","Using a spoon, add some melted chocolate from the skillet or saucepan to fill in the gaps and smooth it to create a seal.  Once the chocolate has hardened, flip the bomb over so that the “lid” is now on the bottom.","Decorate by drizzling melted chocolate that matches the shell or contrasting melted chocolate to make a pretty design. Add holiday sprinkles for a finishing touch!"]
