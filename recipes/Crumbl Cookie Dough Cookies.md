prepTime: "45 minutes"
instructions: ["Line 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper. Set aside.","For the cookies, in a large mixing bowl, beat the butter with brown sugar for several minutes. It should be fully combined. Add in eggs, oil, and vanilla extract. Beat until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.","Slowly add in flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt. Mix just until combined.","Scoop 1/4 cup dough into your hands and roll dough into a ball. Place onto the baking sheet (they can be placed close together since you will be chilling the dough before baking).","Repeat until you have all the dough rolled, it will make about 18 balls. Place cookie sheet of rolled balls into the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Remove cookie dough from refrigerator. Place 6 balls on the other parchment paper lined cookie sheet. Using the bottom of a glass (or measuring cup), press each dough ball down until it is about 1/2-3/4 inch thick (the edges may crack slightly which is okay).","Bake cookies for about 10-12 minutes, until lightly blonde in color (not golden). Remove and cool completely. Repeat until all cookies have been baked and cooled.","To make the frosting, beat butter until pale in color (2-3 minutes). Add in sugars and vanilla. Beat until combined. Reduce speed of mixer and slowly add in the heavy cream (and salt). Beat until fluffy, several minutes to achieve this.","Transfer frosting to a piping bag with an open round tip (or no tip at all). Pipe onto the cooled cookies by starting in the center and spiraling your way to the edges. Use the back of a spoon to smooth the buttercream, giving them flat tops.","Sprinkle the top of each cookie with mini semi-sweet chocolate chips and small pieces of edible cookie dough.","Chill cookies until ready to serve."]
