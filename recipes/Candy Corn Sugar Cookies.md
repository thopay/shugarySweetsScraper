ingredients: ["1 ½ cups all-purpose flour","1 ½ teaspoons baking powder","¼ teaspoon kosher salt","½ cup unsalted butter, softened","½ cup granulated sugar","1 large egg yolk, room temperature","1 teaspoon vanilla extract","½ teaspoon almond extract","3 drops gel food coloring (orange)","3 Tablespoons milk","1 cup Ghirardelli dark chocolate melting wafers","1 cup Ghirardelli white chocolate melting wafers"]
serves: 12
time: "1 hour 29 minutes"
prepTime: "20 minutes"
instructions: ["In a medium bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside.","In a large mixing bowl, beat together the butter and sugar until combined. Add in egg yolk, vanilla, and almond extract. Add food coloring. Beat until combined.","Add half the flour mixture to the mixing bowl and all of the milk. Mix just until combined, and then add the remaining flour, mixing just until combined.","Divide dough into two balls. Cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate for an hour or until firm.","Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.","Remove cookie dough from the refrigerator. Roll out each ball between sheets of parchment paper until the dough is an approximate 7” x 11” rectangle shape that is ¼” thick. The parchment paper will prevent the cookie dough from sticking to the rolling pin. You could skip that parchment and just use a lightly floured work surface instead.","Using a knife, cut 2 straight lines along the length of the rectangle to square off the dough. (See photos in blog post for visual guide). Cut triangles approximately 3 ½” wide at their wide end and narrowing to a point. Rotate the direction of the triangles you cut so that the point of one end becomes the wide end of the next triangle. You can also use cookie cutters - dust cookie cutters with flour so they do not stick to the dough.","Ball up leftover dough and roll out to create more triangles. You should be able to make 12 large triangles (6 from each ball of dough).","Transfer triangles to a baking sheet covered in parchment paper. Leave 2 inches between each cookie to allow for the cookie to expand while cooking.","Bake for 9-11 minutes, do not overbake.","Remove from oven and cool completely on a wire rack.","Melt chocolates in two separate bowls. Dip the pointed end of the cookie in white chocolate and the larger end into the dark chocolate. Place on parchment paper to set."]
