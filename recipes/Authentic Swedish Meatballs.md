serves: 75
time: "1 hour 30 minutes"
prepTime: "45 minutes"
instructions: ["In a large mixing bowl, combine ground beef, ground pork, minced onion, breadcrumbs, seasonings, eggs, and heavy cream. Using your hands, combine ingredients completely until thoroughly mixed.","Roll mixture into 1-inch sized meatballs, packing tightly. Set aside until all the mixture is used. You should be able to make about 75 meatballs.","Heat a large cast iron skillet on medium high heat. Add meatballs in a single layer with a little bit of space between each one. Cook several minutes then rotate the meatballs to cook evenly on all sides. Once cooked, remove meatballs onto a serving plate, and add more (I had to do about 3 rounds).","Once all the meatballs are cooked, remove them all from the pan and add the butter for the sauce. Using a whisk, melt butter with the drippings in the pan. Sprinkle the flour over the melted butter and whisk over medium heat for about 1 minute. Add in the beef stock, salt, pepper, and allspice. Whisk until no lumps (except the possible meatball pieces from the pan). Turn heat down to low, add in the heavy cream, and simmer for another 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Once the sauce is thickened, return the meatballs to the skillet and simmer until heated (only takes a couple minutes).","To serve, sprinkle with parsley. Enjoy with mashed potatoes!"]
