instructions: ["Place ⅓ cup popcorn kernels in a paper lunch sack.  Fold the top down making 2 folds. ","Set the bag upright in the microwave.  If the bag tips over while the popcorn is popping, it’s ok.  It will not affect the popcorn. ","Microwave for 1 and-a-half minutes or until there is 1-2 seconds between popping kernels.  It is better to have a few unpopped kernels than a whole bag of burned popcorn. ","Always monitor the popping process.  Leaving the bag unattended and microwaving for too long may result in fire.","After the popcorn is done popping, remove the bag and add desired toppings."]
