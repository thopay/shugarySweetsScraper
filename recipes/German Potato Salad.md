serves: 6
time: "22 minutes"
prepTime: "10 minutes"
instructions: ["Wash potatoes and cut them into 1-inch pieces. My potatoes were small to medium, and I cut each potato half into 4-6 pieces.  ","Add the potatoes to the Instant Pot (no trivet needed.) Pour the chicken broth over the potatoes.","Put the lid on the Instant Pot and set the valve to SEALING. Select the HIGH PRESSURE or MANUAL setting and set the timer for 6 minutes.  ","Once the cook time has ended, carefully do a quick release of pressure by turning the valve to venting.","Open the Instant Pot and drain the liquid from potatoes by pouring them into a colander. The potatoes should be fork tender. Set the potatoes aside.","Select the SAUTE function and add the bacon to the Instant Pot. Stir the bacon occasionally and saute until it has browned, about 5 minutes.","Add the chopped onion to the bacon and saute for 1 minute, stirring constantly. The bottom of the Instant Pot will be brown from cooking the bacon and onion. This is normal.","Turn the Instant Pot off. Add the potatoes back into the Instant Pot and gently stir to coat them with the bacon and onion mixture. Some of the potatoes may slightly break apart.","In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, sugar, olive oil, water, and dijon mustard. Pour this mixture into the Instant Pot over the potatoes and gently stir to coat.  ","Garnish with parsley and add salt and pepper to taste."]
