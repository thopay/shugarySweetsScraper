ingredients: ["2 Tbsp olive oil","3 lb chuck roast, cut into chunks","3/4 cup beef broth","1 dry package ranch dressing","1 dry package au jus mix","6-8 whole pepperoncini peppers","1/4 cup liquid from pepperoncini pepper jar","4 Tbsp unsalted butter","1/4 cup cornstarch, optional"]
serves: 8
time: "1 hour 10 minutes"
prepTime: "5 minutes"
instructions: ["Plug in pressure cooker and select \"SAUTE.\" Add olive oil to the bottom of the pot. Add the chunks of chuck roast and saute 5 minutes on each side.Â ","When all pieces of chuck roast have been browned, remove and set aside.","While on saute, add in beef broth to the pressure cooker. Using a wooden spoon, scrape up as much of the browned bits off the bottom of the pan.","Once deglazed, hit the cancel button and add the au just packet, ranch packet, liquid from the pepperonicini pepper jar, the peppers, and butter. Give a quick stir, then return the roast back to the Instant Pot.","Lock the lid in place and select \"HIGH PRESSURE\" for a cook time of 50 minutes. If your roast is closer to 4- 4 1/2 lbs, add an additional 10-15 minutes of cook time.","When cook time ends, allow pressure to NATURALLY RELEASE. This means you leave it alone until the silver valve drops. This will usually take about 20 minutes.","For an optional, thicker gravy, remove the beef from the Instant Pot after it has naturally released pressure. Place on a cutting board and shred beef into desired size pieces.","While the beef is out of the pot you can make the gravy thicker.","In a small bowl, whisk together 1/4 cup cornstarch with about 1/4 cup of the hot liquid from the sauce.","Turn the Instant Pot on \"SAUTE\" and allow it to cook and bubble for about 1-2 minutes, until thickened.","Return the beef to the hot liquid and enjoy."]
