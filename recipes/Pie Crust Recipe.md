ingredients: ["2 cups all-purpose flour","Pinch of salt","3/4 cup unsalted butter, chilled","2 egg yolks","4 tablespoons of ice water"]
serves: 1
time: "50 minutes"
prepTime: "20 minutes"
instructions: ["In a large bowl, sift flour and salt together. Cut the chilled butter into pieces and add to the bowl of flour. Using your fingers, pinch the butter and flour together to combine. Continue until no large clumps of butter remain.  ","In a small bowl, combine the egg yolks and ice water. Add the egg and water mixture, a little at a time, to the flour and butter, mixing quickly with a fork. Once all the liquid has been added, you should be able to squeeze a portion of dough in your hand, and it should hold together.  ","Transfer the dough to a clean work surface and continue to form the dough into a flat disc. Shaping it like this will make it easier to roll out later. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator to rest for approximately 30 minutes. ","When the dough is done chilling, lightly flour your work surface and unwrap the dough. ","Flour the top of the disc of dough and, using a rolling pin, begin to push down (do not roll) and flatten the dough. To ensure that the dough isn’t sticking to your work surface, periodically turn the dough, about a quarter turn.  ","Once your disc has been flattened to a diameter of about 8 inches, begin rolling out the dough.  If any cracks start to form along the edges, seal them back together with your fingers. You can use a little bit of water to aid in this. However, if you add too much water, it can make your dough very sticky and hard to work with. If you leave the cracks, they will only get larger. ","Continue to roll the dough until it is about ⅛ inch thick.","To transfer the crust to your pie plate, roll it up onto your rolling pin. And then roll it back out so that it covers your plate.  ","Push the crust down into your pie plate and trim off the excess dough that hangs over the edge.","Using a fork, poke holes in the bottom of the crust. ","Use in your favorite pie recipes!","If your recipe calls for a blind-baked crust (or a pre-baked crust), use parchment paper to line the inside of the crust, shaping it around the inner edges to form a mold of the crust.","Fill the parchment paper lined bottom of the crust with pie weights or dried beans. Bake immediately at 400°F for 15 minutes.","Remove the pan from the oven, and carefully lift out the parchment paper with weights. If the bottom crust has started to bubble up, poke it with a fork a few times.","Return the crust to the oven for 11-13 minutes for a partially baked pie crust (it should be lightly browned), or 15-17 minutes for a fully baked pie crust (it should be a deep golden brown)."]
