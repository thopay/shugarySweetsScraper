time: "50 minutes"
prepTime: "30 minutes"
instructions: ["Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Thaw the refrigerated pie crust, according to package directions.  ","Line a large cookie sheet with parchment paper. Set aside. In a small bowl, whisk eggs with water, for egg wash, set aside.","Using a rolling pin, roll out one thawed pie crust, ensuring there are no cracks or holes. The crust should be between ¼” and ⅛” thick.","Use a 3-4 inch holiday tree cookie cutter to cut out about 7 trees. Save the excess crust. Repeat with all the remaining pie crusts, saving the excess crusts from each roll. When all the ready-made pie crust has been used, and all that remains is the excess, combine it all and roll it out, the same thickness as the original crusts, to complete the remaining hand pies.","Place trees on the parchment lined baking sheet and spoon about 1 - 1 ½ Tablespoons of cherry pie filling into the center of each tree. Brush the border around the filling with egg wash.","Gently place the trees over the top of the filling. Starting at the trunk, lightly press the edges together, making sure not to press down on the filling.  ","Using the tines of a fork, press the seams together, working around the outline of the tree. Using a sharp knife, make a few slits in the top crust for venting. Brush the top crusts with remaining egg wash and sprinkle with coarse sanding sugar, if desired.","Bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Transfer to a cooling rack. Serve warm or at room temperature."]
