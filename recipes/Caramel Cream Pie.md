serves: 12
time: "55 minutes"
prepTime: "15 minutes"
instructions: ["Blend flour and salt in a large bowl. Cut shortening into flour mixture using a pastry blender (or fork). Stir in water, by tablespoon, until dough holds together (I used 4 Tbsp)","Test dough for proper moistness by squeezing a marble sized ball of dough in your hand. If it holds together firmly, you're good. If it crumbles, add more water (tablespoon at a time) until dough is moist enough to form a smooth ball.","Shape dough into a ball. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (up to 48 hours).","Roll dough from center outward into a circle on a lightly floured surface. You want the circle to be about 2 inches larger than your pie plate. Transfer dough to pie plate. Trim edges of dough, folding the edge under to flute dough as desired. Prick bottom of crust with a fork.","Bake crust in a 425 degree oven (in the lower third of the oven) for 10-12 minutes, until golden brown.","Remove from oven and cool completely.","In a large mixing bowl, beat cream cheese with 1/2 cup of dulce de leche and powdered sugar. Set aside. In a clean and COLD mixing bowl, beat heavy cream with granulated sugar for a couple minutes until stiff peaks form. Remove about 1/2 cup of the whipped cream and reserve it for the garnish.","To the remainder of the whipped cream, fold in the caramel cream cheese mixture until fully blended. With the remaining dulce de leche, reserve about 1-2 Tbsp for garnish. Spread the remainder in the bottom of your cooled pie crust. Top with caramel cream mixture. Top with reserved whipped cream. Melt dulce de leche in microwave and drizzle over pie. Refrigerate pie for 4 hours or overnight. Slice and enjoy!"]
