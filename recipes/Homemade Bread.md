ingredients: ["2 ¼ teaspoon active dry yeast (1 package)","2 ¼ cups warm water","¼ c sugar","1 tablespoon salt","2 tablespoons oil","6 ½ cups bread flour"]
serves: 32
time: "2 hours 45 minutes"
prepTime: "15 minutes"
instructions: ["In a large mixing bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water with a pinch of the sugar.  When the yeast is bubbly and foamy, add the sugar, salt, oil and 4 cups of flour, and mix until smooth.","Add remaining flour, ½ cup at a time, to form a soft, smooth dough.  You'll know you've reached this point when the dough should stick just slightly to your finger when touched, but not be overly sticky.  Knead 5-7 minutes using the dough hook on your mixer, or do this by hand.","Place the dough in an oiled bowl, turn over once to coat the top with oil and cover with plastic wrap.  Allow dough to rise one hour, or until doubled.","After one hour, when the dough has risen, punch it down gently and divide in half.  Roll each half of the dough into a long rectangle about 8 inches wide.  Roll the dough up, starting at the short edge, to form a cylinder that is approximately 8 inches wide. Repeat with remaining dough. ","Place the dough, seam side down, into lightly greased bread pans, and cover with plastic wrap.  Let rise one hour, or until the dough is ½-1 inch higher than the top of the pan.  ","Preheat the oven to 375.  Bake 30-35 minutes or until the loaves are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped.  Brush with melted butter if desired. Remove to a cooling rack and cool before slicing.  MAKES 2 LOAVES."]
