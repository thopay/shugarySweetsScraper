serves: 32
time: "15 minutes"
prepTime: "5 minutes"
instructions: ["Line a 15x10-inch baking sheet with parchment paper. Set aside.","In a medium saucepan, add butter, sugar, and salt over medium heat while stirring constantly. Once the butter is melted, keep stirring as the mixture begins to boil.","The toffee mixture will begin to bubble and boil and you'll watch it change color. When it changes to the color of raw almonds, that's when you will remove it from the heat (you'll see that caramel color!). This takes about 5-8 minutes.","Quickly stir in the vanilla extract and pour onto the parchment paper lined baking sheet. Using an offset spatula, spread to desired thickness.","In a microwave safe glass bowl, heat Ghirardelli white chocolate wafers for one minute. Stir until smooth and pour over toffee while warm. Sprinkle immediately with cinnamon sugar mixture!","Allow toffee to set and chocolate to harden. When set, break into pieces and enjoy."]
