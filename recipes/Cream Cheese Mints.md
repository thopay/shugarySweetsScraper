ingredients: ["1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened","1 package (8 ounce) cream cheese, softened","2 pounds powdered sugar, divided (this is about 7 1/2 cups)","1 1/2 teaspoon pure mint extract","gel food coloring, optional"]
serves: 100
time: "30 minutes"
prepTime: "30 minutes"
instructions: ["In a large mixing bowl with whisk attachment, beat butter and cream cheese until fully combined, about 3-4 minutes. Beat in extract.","Add 7 cups of the powdered sugar (reserving about 1 cup for later). Mix on the lowest speed until it comes together (trust me it will)! Once it combines (into what resembles a very thick frosting), turn the mixer higher and beat until fluffy (and additional 2 minutes).","Divide mint mixture into small bowls (one for every color you decide to use). Add one SMALL drop of color to each bowl and mix until combined. I use a butter knife and stir vigorously, it seems to work best.","Cover each bowl and refrigerate for at least two hours, or overnight.","On a large cookie sheet (you'll need 2-3), line with parchment paper. Sprinkle with a generous amount of the reserved powdered sugar.","Scoop about 3/4 teaspoon of mint dough into hands and roll into a ball (I use a teaspoon dipped in powdered sugar to do this part). Drop each ball onto the baking sheet. Repeat until pan is filled.","Using a fork dipped in powdered sugar, press into the tops gently. Sprinkle with more powdered sugar and allow to set about 4 hours (uncovered).","When mints have harded, place in airtight container in refrigerator (use parchment paper to separate layers if desired)."]
