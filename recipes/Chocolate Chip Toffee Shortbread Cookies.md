instructions: ["Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 15x10 inch baking sheet with parchment paper or silpat. Set aside.","In a large mixing bowl, beat butter with powdered sugar, vanilla, and almond extracts until creamy. Add in flour and mix until combined. Fold in toffee and chocolate chips.","Mixture may be very crumbly. Use your hands to combine into a ball, the warmth of your hands will bring it together.","Drop dough onto center of baking sheet, using the heels of your hands, press the dough into a large rectangle. You want the dough to be the same thickness throughout, so keep pressing until you have a rectangle about 12x10 inches and about 1/4 inch thick.","Bake for 20-25 minutes, until edges begin to lightly brown. Remove from oven and immediately cut into strips (using a pizza cutter or sharp knife, going slowly). You can cut into triangles if you prefer. Cool completely."]
