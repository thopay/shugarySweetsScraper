instructions: ["Wash zucchini and cut off ends.  No need to peel the zucchini.  The dark green skin adds beautiful vibrant color to the dish. ","Cut zucchini into zoodles using desired method (hand spiralizer or mandoline works). ","Heat olive oil in a large skillet.  Add zucchini to skillet and saute for 2-3 minutes, just until tender.  Zucchini will become mushy if it’s overcooked.  The goal here is to mainly heat them up and not actually “cook” them.  Depending on your sauce or toppings, the zoodles may continue to cook when the topping is added."]
