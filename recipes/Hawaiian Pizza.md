serves: 6
time: "40 minutes"
prepTime: "20 minutes"
instructions: ["Preheat oven to 425 degree F.","In a large bowl, combine 2 cup of all-purpose flour, undissolved yeast, sugar and salt. Add very warm water and oil, mixing until well blended. (I used my electric mixer with paddle attachment). Gradually add the remaining flour to make a soft dough. The dough should form a ball and will be slightly sticky.","Knead dough on a floured surface until smooth and elastic, for about 4 minutes (I used my electric mixer with dough hook attachment for this part instead, it worked great!!). Divide dough in half and cover with a clean dry towel until toppings are ready.","No need to allow this to rise! This makes TWO pizza crusts. Use one for the hawaiian pizza, and use the second for your pizza of choice!","Pat each portion of dough with floured hands to make a 12inch round pizza (using a baking pizza stone or round pizza pan). Form a rim by pinching the edge of the dough.","Spread your bbq sauce on bottom of each crust. Top with shredded pork, red onion and pineapple. Sprinkle pizzas with three cheeses.","Bake in oven for 18-20 minutes, until cheese is bubbly and melted and the crust is browned. Slice and enjoy immediately!!"]
