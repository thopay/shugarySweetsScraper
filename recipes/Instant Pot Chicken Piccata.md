instructions: ["Combine flour, salt, and pepper on a large plate. Set aside.","Slice chicken breast lengthwise (butterflied) so you now have 4 pieces. (or use 4 thin sliced chicken tenders).","Select \"SAUTE\" on the Instant Pot and add olive oil.","Dredge chicken fillets in flour mixture so both sides are lightly coated. Place in pot and brown on both sides - about 2 minutes each side. Work in batches if needed. Remove chicken from pot to a plate.","Add broth and wine to pot and deglaze the bottom, using a wooden spoon to scrape up all the bits and browned pieces stuck to the bottom.","Turn off the pot. Add garlic, butter, juice of one lemon, and the capers. Stir once, then place the trivet (if you have one) in the bottom of the pot (otherwise just place chicken in broth mixture). Place chicken back in pot on top of trivet.","Lock the lid in place and set vent to \"SEALING\". Cook on HIGH PRESSURE for 3 minutes. When pot beeps, allow to naturally release for 10 minutes.","Release any remaining pressure by using the quick release VENTING valve, then remove lid.","Remove chicken and trivet and set aside. To thicken the sauce a bit, set pot to SAUTE and allow to simmer and bubble for 2 to 3 minutes. Turn off the pot and place chicken back in to coat with sauce.","Serve Chicken Piccata warm, over rice or pasta. Garnish with parsley and cheese, and lemon slices if desired"]
