prepTime: "50 minutes"
instructions: ["In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt. Add cubed butter and combine with a pastry blender until dough begins to form crumbs. Using your hands, continue to work the dough until it begins to hold together when squeezed.  ","Add beaten egg yolks and water and combine with a spoon or spatula until dough comes together in a ball. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.","While the pastry dough is chilling, make the filling by peeling, coring and thinly slicing apples into an extra large mixing bowl. ","Combine the sugar, flour, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1 teaspoon nutmeg and salt in a small bowl and sprinkle over the sliced apples, tossing to coat.","Combine remaining 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 1 teaspoon nutmeg in a small dish and set aside.","After dough is done chilling, preheat oven to 425 degrees F.","Divide the dough in 2 equal halves, one for the bottom crust and one for the top. Roll out the dough for the bottom crust on a lightly floured surface or silpat so that it’s just slightly larger than the jelly roll pan (10-inch x 15-inch x 1-inch pan).  This will allow for the extra that you will need to crimp the crust edge closed.","To easily transfer the crust to the jelly roll pan, use the rolling pin and roll the crust back onto it.","Unroll the crust off the rolling pin and onto the jelly roll pan, allowing the extra to drape over the sides and ends. If needed, press the crust into the corners.","Using a slotted spoon, add and evenly spread the apple filling into the crust. There will be a lot of filling and the apples will seem like they’re piled quite high, but they will cook down during baking.","Sprinkle the additional cinnamon nutmeg mixture over the apple filling. Dot the top of the filling with butter.","Roll out the second half of the dough in the same manner as the first half, making sure to make the top crust big enough to cover the piled apple filling. Transfer the top crust using the rolling pin method.","Pinch the edges of the crust together by rolling it and tucking it so that it is on the inside edge of the jelly roll pan. Using the tines of a fork, press the 2 crusts together and seal the edge all the way around. Prick the top of the crust with a fork to allow the filling to vent during baking.","Place foil or a larger cookie sheet on the rack underneath the jelly roll pan to catch any drips that may occur during baking. ","Bake at 425℉ for 20 minutes and then reduce the oven temperature to 350℉ and bake an additional 30 minutes. Cool completely before adding the icing.","For the icing, stir all ingredients together in a small bowl until smooth. Drizzle over the top."]
