instructions: ["Cook large shells pasta according to package directions. Once cooked, separate and place on parchment paper on counter. Set aside.","While pasta is cooking, brown Italian sausage in a large skillet. Once browned, drain grease and return meat to skillet. Add in spinach, butter and onion. Saute for about 2 minutes.","Add in salt, pepper, garlic salt, worcestershire, oregano, and hot sauce. Mix until well combined.","Fold in parmesan cheese and 2 cup mozzarella cheese.","Using a large spoon, stuff each shell with sausage mixture, until all shells are stuffed. Place shells in ziploc bag and freeze until ready to use. When ready to cook, follow step 6 below.","When ready to bake, pour about 2 cup of Prego sauce in bottom of baking dish. Choose a dish size that will fit the number of shells you are going to be cooking. For my family, we each eat about 2-3 shells per meal. On top of sauce, add shells, then more sauce, if desired. Cover dish with foil and bake for 45 minutes in a 350F oven. Remove foil and add remaining 2 cup cheese. Bake an additional 5-15 minutes, until sauce on bottom is bubbly and mixture inside shells is fully heated, and cheese is melted."]
