instructions: ["Prepare pasta according to package directions","In a small bowl you'll mix up your blackening seasoning. It includes paprika, cayenne pepper, salt, pepper, white pepper, and Italian seasoning. Turn on broiler.","Using a cast iron skillet or a skillet that can go under the broiler, place your salmon in the skillet, skin side down. Brush salmon with melted butter and press seasoning mix all over the salmon. If your salmon has skin on, only season the flesh side. Before cooking flip your salmon to skin side up. Broil for 3 minutes. Remove from oven and flip salmon to skin side down.","Cook an additional 7 minutes, until salmon is cooked and flakes easily with a fork. Depending on the thickness of your salmon, you may need to cook longer. Try to purchase salmon that is equal in thickness.","Remove from oven and remove salmon from skillet. If your fish has skin on, remove skin at this point.","Return skillet to stove top to prepare the creamy garlic sauce. Add the heavy cream, chicken broth, 4 cloves of pressed garlic, salt and pepper, and parmesan cheese. Whisk over medium high heat until bubbly. It won't take long for your sauce to thicken over medium high heat. ","Once thickened, add in spinach and tomatoes and cook for a few minutes until spinach has wilted down. Add the salmon to the large skillet over medium heat and cook for a few minutes until warmed up again. ","Season with salt and pepper as desired.","Serve over a bed of pasta and enjoy!"]
