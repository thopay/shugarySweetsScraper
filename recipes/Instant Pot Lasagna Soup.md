instructions: ["Turn the pressure cooker on “SAUTE” and add the Italian sausage, garlic, onion, and green pepper to the pot. Using a wooden spoon, break it up and cook until the meat is done (several minutes until no pink appears).","Turn the IP off, then using a slotted spoon, remove all the meat and vegetables to a paper towel lined plate, then drain the grease.","Add ONE CUP of water to the hot Instant Pot and deglaze the pan. This means, scrape the bottom of the pan using the wooden spoon to remove any bits of meat that are stuck.","Add the remaining water, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, brown sugar, Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, broken uncooked noodles, and the cooked meat/vegetables. Give a quick stir.","Lock the lid in place and make sure the valve on top is set to “SEALING.”","Select HIGH PRESSURE for a cook time of 2 minutes. Once the cook time ends, allow to naturally release pressure for 5 minutes, then do a quick release of pressure until the valve drops.","Open the lid and stir. If adding the cheese to the soup, dollop the ricotta into the hot soup, give a stir until blended.","Ladle the soup into bowls and serve with mozzarella cheese and parmesan cheese. ENJOY!"]
