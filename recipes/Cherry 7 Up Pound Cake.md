Add in sugar and salt and cream together for an additional 7 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl a couple times. Mixture will be very pale yellow and fluffy.","Add in the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.","Slowly add in flour, being careful not to over beat (turn the mixer down to low at this time). Pour in Cherry 7Up and mix just until combined. Fold in maraschino cherries.","Pour batter into prepared pan and bake for 75-85 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cake to cool in pan for about 10 minutes, then invert on serving plate. Cool completely before adding glaze.","For the glaze, divide the powdered sugar in half by adding 1 cup to two bowls. To one bowl, add in cherry juice. Whisk until smooth. To the other bowl, add in milk, whisk until smooth.","Pour the white glaze over the top of the cake first. Then drizzle with the cherry glaze.
