instructions: ["In a small saucepan, simmer the apple cider over low heat until all the remains is 1/2 cup. This process takes about 30 minutes. Stir occasionally and start checking it at about the 20 minute mark. Set aside and cool.","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 6 cavity donut pan with non-stick baking spray and set aside.","In a mixing bowl, beat the melted butter, egg, sugars, yogurt, and vanilla extract until creamy (scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed).","Add in the flour, baking soda, baking powder, apple pie spice, and salt. Slowly pour in the 1/2 cup of apple cider and beat until batter is smooth. Fold in shredded apples.","Spoon the donut batter into a large ziploc bag. Snip off the corner and pipe into prepared donut pan, filling each cavity about half full (recipe makes 12 donuts).","Bake in oven for 12-14 minutes, until lightly browned and donut springs from the fingertips when touched.","Remove from oven, cool one minute in the pan, then invert onto a wire cooling rack.","For the topping, combine the sugar and cinnamon into a small bowl (or pie plate).","Dip slightly cooled donuts in the melted butter (coating both sides), then dip in cinnamon sugar mix. Return to wire rack and repeat for remaining donuts. Enjoy warm."]
