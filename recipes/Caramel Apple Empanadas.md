instructions: ["Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Remove pie crusts from their packaging and allow to come to room temperature.","In two small bowls, separate egg white from egg yolk. KEEP BOTH. Whisk each one separately. Set aside.","Dump apple pie filling into a small bowl. Chop up apple slices into small bits. Set aside.","In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese with granulated sugar and vanilla extract until smooth and creamy.","Unroll pie crusts and cut circles using a 4-inch circle biscuit cutter. Re-roll the scraps once to get more circles.","Using a 1 Tbsp scoop, spoon half a scoop of apple pie filling and half a scoop of cheesecake filling into the center of each pie crust circle. Brush the edges of the circle with the whisked egg white.","Fold each empanada in half and pinch the edges close (either by folding or pressing with a fork). Place on a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Repeat for remaining apple hand pies.","Prick each empanada with a fork before baking. Brush tops of empanadas with whisked egg yolk, in a thin, even coating.Â ","Bake apple empanadas for about 15 minutes, until golden brown. Remove and cool on wire rack.","Make the glaze by whisking together powdered sugar with caramel ice cream topping and milk. Add more or less milk to desired consistency. For a thicker glaze (like I used), I did 2 Tbsp milk. Add up to 4 Tbsp for a thinner glaze.","Dip cooled empanadas into the caramel glaze and return to parchment paper lined baking sheet to set."]
