prepTime: "15 minutes"
instructions: ["In a medium mixing bowl, whisk flour, cinnamon, baking soda, salt and cornstarch together. Set aside.","In a large bowl, combine butter and brown sugar together with a hand mixer on high speed for about 2 minutes. Scrape the sides of the bowl as needed. Add the eggs and vanilla and beat for another minute.","Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and beat on low, just until combined. Add in the old-fashioned oats and combine on low speed. Fold in all but ½ cup of the semi-sweet chocolate chips.","Cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.","Preheat oven to 350℉. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Set aside.","Drop cookie dough by about 2-3 Tablespoons of dough onto the baking sheet. Press 5-6 chocolate chips into the tops of the cookie.","Bake for 10-12 minutes. Don’t overbake. The edges will start to brown first. The middle of the cookie may seem like it’s underbaked, but it will continue to bake when it’s taken out of the oven.","Remove the cookies from the oven and allow them to sit on the baking sheet for an additional 5 minutes. Transfer them to a wire rack to finish cooling."]
