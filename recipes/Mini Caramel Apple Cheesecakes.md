instructions: ["Process gingersnap cookies in a food processor until they become fine crumbs. You'll need 1 1/2 cups of cookie crumbs (about 28 gingersnap cookies, if you're counting).","Once processed, stir in melted butter with a fork. Set aside.","Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Line a muffin tin with paper muffin cups. Using a small metal scoop, spoon an oversized scoop of crumbs into the bottom of each paper cup. Approximately 1 1/2 Tbsp of crumbs. Fill all the muffin cups. You should have 18 in total.","Using a tart shaper (or your fingers), press crumbs into the bottom firmly. Bake for about 5 minutes, then remove and cool while making the filling.","Start by peeling and chopping two large apples into tiny bits. Place in a bowl with 1 tsp of fresh lemon juice and set aside.","In a large mixing bowl, combine softened cream cheese with sugar. Beat until creamy. Add eggs, one at a time, then add in the greek yogurt, all-purpose flour, and vanilla extract. Mix just until blended, do not over beat.","Divide batter into the prepared crusts, approximately 1/4 cup (I use my large metal scoop for this).Â ","Top each cheesecake with a spoonful of the diced apples.","In a small bowl, combine the oats, flour, brown sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon, salt, and butter. Use your hands to mix into small crumbles (or a pastry cutter works too).","Sprinkle streusel over the tops of each apple cheesecake, dividing it up until you've used all of it!","Bake cheesecakes in preheated oven for about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and cool completely on a wire rack, then transfer to the refrigerator for at least 3 hours, or overnight.","When ready to serve, drizzle with caramel sauce!"]
