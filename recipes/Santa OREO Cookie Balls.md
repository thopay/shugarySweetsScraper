instructions: ["Begin by processing OREO cookies in a food processor until finely ground. Transfer to a large bowl and mix with the softened cream cheese until fully combined.","Line a large freezer safe baking sheet with parchment paper.","Scoop cookie balls with a 1 Tbsp cookie scoop, or a heaping tablespoon of dough. Using your hands, roll into a ball (will be about 1 inch). Pinch the top of the ball and shape until you have a cone, that resembles a Santa hat. Repeat until all dough is used.","Freeze cookie balls for at least one hour.","Melt red candy melts in a bowl according to package directions. Using a toothpick in the top of the frozen santa hat cookie ball, dip into the red candy coating. Tap on side of bowl so the excess drips off. Set back on parchment paper and repeat until all hats are completely covered in red. Once all hats are covered in red, dip the bottom of a mini marshmallow in red candy coating and attach it to the top of the hat. Allow red coating to harden completely, about 15-30 minutes.","Melt white candy coating in bowl according to package directions. Pour sprinkles in a shallow dish/bowl.","Dip marshmallow end of hat completely into the white candy coating, then dip into sprinkles. Repeat with all hats and allow to harden (15 minutes). Once tops are hardened, repeat with the brim of the hat. Dip it in white chocolate, then in sprinkles, then allow to harden. These are now ready to eat and enjoy! I store mine in the refrigerator until ready to serve, they keep well in a covered container for up to a week."]
