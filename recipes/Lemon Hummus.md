instructions: ["Rinse beans and peel off skins (I do this by pinching them, they pop right out of the skin). This is optional, but it does result in a creamier texture.","In a food processor, combine beans, tahini, lemon juice, lemon zest and salt. Process for several minutes until beans are pureed. While running, slowly drizzle in the olive oil until well blended.","To serve, spread on a medium plate (or pie plate). Drizzle with additional olive oil (about 1 Tbsp) if desired and sprinkle with additional lemon zest (optional). Store covered in air tight container."]
