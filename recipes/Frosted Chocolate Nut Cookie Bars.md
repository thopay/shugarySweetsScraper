Set aside.","In a large mixing bowl, beat butter with brown sugar for 2-3 minutes until fully combined.","Beat in vanilla and eggs. Add flour, cocoa, salt, baking soda, cinnamon and nutmeg. Blend completely. Fold in chocolate chips and nuts.","Drop cookie dough onto parchment paper lined baking sheet. Using finger tips (dipped in flour) press cookie dough into pan evenly (dough will be sticky, so keep dipping those fingers in flour).","Bake for 22-25 minutes. Do not overbake. Allow to cool completely in pan.","Once cooled, cut cookie bars into desired shape, either squares or using a cookie cutter.","For the frosting, beat butter for two minutes until soft and creamy. Add almond extract, cocoa, powdered sugar and 2 Tbsp milk. Beat for 3-4 minutes until light and fluffy, adding more milk ifÂ needed.","Pipe frosting onto cookies. If desired, sprinkle with extra sliced almonds. Or, if making footballs, place melted white chocolate into a ziploc bag. Snip off the corner and pipe \"laces\" onto the cookies. ENJOY"]
