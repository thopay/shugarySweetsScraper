serves: 8
time: "7 hours 20 minutes"
prepTime: "15 minutes"
instructions: ["Line the bottom of a 7x3-inch springform pan with parchment paper. Set aside.","In a food processor, pulse cookies with melted butter, brown sugar, and nutmeg. Pour crumbs into bottom of springform pan and press with palm of hand until packed. Refrigerate pan with crust while preparing the filling.","In a large mixing bowl, beat cream cheese with sugar until creamy. Add in eggs, eggnog, nutmeg, and cornstarch, scraping down the sides to ensure everything is well blended.","Pour the filling into the springform pan, on top of the crust layer. Wrap the top of the cheesecake in a foil tent. Then place the cheesecake on a second piece of foil, wrapping the sides up over the top.","Add water to the bottom of the 6qt Instant Pot. Place wrapped springform pan on a trivet or sling and lower into the pressure cooker.","Secure the lid, turn the valve on top to SEALING, and set to high pressure with a cook time of 50 minutes.","When cook time ends, allow pressure to naturally release completely (this may take 20-30 minutes).","Lift cheesecake out of Instant Pot by using the trivet handles. Allow cheesecake to cool at room temperature on a cooling rack. The center may look a little jiggly, but will continue to firm as it cool and then chills.","After cheesecake has cooled completely, place in refrigerator for 6 hours, or overnight to chill.","After chilling, remove foil, blot off any condensation with a paper towel. Use a knife to run along the sides of the pan to gently remove cheesecake from the springform pan. Unhinge and slide onto a serving platter.","Serve with whipped cream and a sprinkle of nutmeg if desired."]
