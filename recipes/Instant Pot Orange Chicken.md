instructions: ["In the Instant Pot on SAUTE, add the olive oil with chicken pieces. Saute for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally until chicken is mostly cooked.","Add orange juice to the pot and using a wooden spoon, scrape up the bits on the bottom of the pot so you don't get the burn notice (this is called deglazing). Turn off.","Add ginger, garlic, sesame oil, tomato paste, salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, sugars, and soy sauce to the pot. Do not stir.","Secure the lid and make sure the vent on top of the pot is set to \"SEALING.\" Select High Pressure (or Manuel) for a cook time of 5 minutes.","When cook time ends, allow pot to naturally release pressure for ten minutes, then move the valve on top to \"VENTING\" to release the remaining pressure.","In a small bowl, whisk the orange juice with cornstarch. Open the lid, stir the chicken and add the slurry to the pot. Select \"SAUTE\" and cook for about 3-4 minutes, until thick and bubbly.","Turn off and allow to thicken for 5 minutes. Add sliced green onions and orange zest to the top. Serve over rice."]
