instructions: ["In mixer, combine eggs, pumpkin and vanilla. Beat until creamy. Beat in spices. Slowly beat in the flour, sugar, baking powder and baking soda. Beat until the crumbly texture becomes smooth.","Fold in chopped pecans.","Form two 12-inch long logs (about 2-3 inches wide) on a parchment lined baking sheet. I use my hands to press dough into the shape.","Bake in a 350 degree oven for 25-30 minutes. Remove from oven.","Turn oven down to 300 degrees. Allow biscotti to cool for about 15 minutes. Using a serated knife, slice biscotti into 1-inch thick slices. Lay each slice on itâ€™s side and return to the oven for an additional 10 minutes. Flip biscotti to opposite side and cook an additional 10 minutes. Remove from oven. The biscotti will continue to harden as it cools.","In microwave safe bowl, add white chocolate morsels and pumpkin pie spice. Microwave on medium heat for 30 second intervals, mixing between each interval. When smooth frost the cooled biscotti.","You can frost the biscotti by dipping the bottoms into the chocolate mixture, and letting the chocolate set (about 1 hour). Or put chocolate in a ziploc bag, snip the corner, and drizzle over the top of the biscotti. Allow to set about an hour. Enjoy!"]
