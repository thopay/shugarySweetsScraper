instructions: ["Preheat oven to 350 degree F. Prepare cupcake tin with cupcake liners. Set aside.","In a large mixing bowl, add chopped chocolate and cocoa powder. Pour hot coffee over both, then stir until chocolate is melted.","Add granulated sugar, flour, salt, baking soda and baking powder. Add in the vanilla extract, eggs, vegetable oil, and buttermilk. Beat for about 4 minutes, scraping down the sides of the mixing bowl several times (and the bottom too to make sure the chocolate doesn't settle).","The batter will be thin, that's okay! Using a large cookie scoop, spoon batter into prepared cupcake tins, about ⅔ full. Bake for 18-20 minutes, until a toothpick in the center comes out clean, or the cupcake springs back from a touch of your finger. Remove and cool completely on wire rack.","For the frosting, beat butter and cream cheese for 3 minutes until fluffy. Add in vanilla, powdered sugar and cream and beat an additional 3-5 minutes.","Fold in 1 1/4 cup mini chocolate morsels. Pipe frosting onto cupcakes. Sprinkle with remaining morsels if desired."]
