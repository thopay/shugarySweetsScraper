ingredients: ["1/2 cup unsalted butter","8 ounce semi-sweet chocolate bar, chopped (or use chocolate chips)","4 large eggs plus 1 large egg yolk","1/2 cup granulated sugar","1 teaspoon vanilla extract","1/4 teaspoon kosher salt","2 cups all-purpose flour"]
serves: 8
time: "29 minutes"
prepTime: "15 minutes"
instructions: ["Preheat oven to 400Â°F. Spray eight 6-ounce ramekins with baking spray. Place them evenly spaced on a baking sheet. Set aside.","In a double boiler, melt butter and chocolate together (you can also do this by placing a heatproof bowl set over a pan with 2-inches of simmering water). Stir until smooth. Remove from heat.","In a large mixing bowl, with whisk attachment on an electric mixer, beat eggs, extra egg yolk, sugar, vanilla, and salt on high speed until the mixture triples in volume. Color will be very pale, and usually takes about 5 minutes!","Add chocolate mixture, and sprinkle flour on top. Gently fold everything together until blended. Scoop (or ladle) batter into prepared ramekins.","You can refrigerate this for up to 8 hours (return to room temperature for about 30 minutes before baking). OR, bake immediately. Place on middle rack in preheated oven for 12-14 minutes, until cakes have puffed up and there is a thin crust on top. The center will be slightly jiggly. Remove from oven and serve hot!","If inverting, run a thin knife around the inside edges of the ramekin to loosen the cake. Invert onto a serving plate and allow the cake to release itself from the ramekin (mine popped out immediately, but it could take a minute). Remove ramekins and sprinkle with powdered sugar if desired. I serve mine in the bowl with a scoop of ice cream! ENJOY!"]
