Select HIGH PRESSURE (or manual) and set time for 8 minutes. ","When done allow the pressure to release naturally for 5 minutes and then quickly release the rest of the pressure.","Remove the silicone molds from the instant pot and open them. Allow to cool a few minutes.","Turn the molds over on plate or tray and carefully tap the bottoms to remove the pancake bites without breaking, or use a spoon to pop them out of the molds.","Drizzle some extra Nutella over the pancake bites and top with sprinkles.","Serve warm with maple syrup, jam, Nutella, honey etc."]
