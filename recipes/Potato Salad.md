instructions: ["Start by cooking your potatoes. I prefer to leave the skin ON, but my Grandma always liked hers peeled. Cut your potatoes into smaller chunks and place them in a large pot with enough water to cover the tops of the potatoes.","Cook over high heat and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce heat to medium low and cover with a lid. Cook potatoes for 15 minutes or until potatoes are soft.","Once the potatoes are done cooking, drain them and then dice them into small bite-sized pieces.","While your potatoes are boiling, you can also make your eggs. Dice your peppers and onions. Remember, you want to dice them in very small pieces, about 1/4”, thumbnail size as my mom always told me!","In a large mixing bowl, mix together the diced potatoes, onions, and peppers. Stir in the diced eggs and mayonnaise.","Stir everything together and season with salt and pepper to taste.","Refrigerate potato salad for at least one hour before serving, allowing the flavors to mingle and chill. Then enjoy!"]
