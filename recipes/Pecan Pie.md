prepTime: "5 minutes"
instructions: ["Preheat oven to 400°F. Blind bake the pie crust. Do this by laying one pie crust in a pie plate. Then place a piece of parchment paper on the pie crust and place pie weights or dried beans on top, so that crust does not bubble up during blind baking. Place in preheated oven for 10-15 minutes, until crust is just starting to brown.","Take crust out of oven, remove parchment and pie weights, and set aside. Lower oven temperature to 350°F. Adjust oven rack to the lower third position.","In a large bowl, whisk the eggs. Add in corn syrup, brown sugar, melted butter, vanilla, and salt. Whisk until smooth. Add 2 cups pecans.","Pour mixture into warm crust. If desired, arrange the remaining pecan halves over the top of the pie, otherwise fold them into the mixture.","Bake for 40-50 minutes, checking to see if the center jiggles slightly. If it shakes too much, keep cooking and check every few minutes, being careful not to overcook. Pecan pie can be very finnicky in cooking times, so start checking at 40 minutes. The filling will continue to set while it cools completely.","Remove from oven and allow to cool completely before slicing. Serve with whipped cream or ice cream if desired!"]
