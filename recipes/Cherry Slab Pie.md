instructions: ["Preheat oven to 425℉.","Empty 2 cans of cherry pie filling into a large bowl. Stir in almond extract and set aside.","Lightly flour a work surface. Unroll 2 thawed pie crusts on top of each other.","Using a large rolling pin, roll out the dough to about a 17”x14” rectangle.","Transfer the dough to a 9”x13” pan and press the crust into the corners of the pan, allowing the dough to hang over the edges.","Pour the pie filling into the prepared pan and spread it out in an even layer. Set aside.","Roll out the third crust and, using a pastry cutter or knife, cut strips that are about ½-inch wide. There should be about 14-15 strips total.","Begin laying the strips across the pan, starting with the longest strip of dough and placing it, diagonally, from corner to corner. The strips should be overlapping or almost touching the edges of the pan.","Fold back every other strip of dough and begin laying the other pieces diagonally across the pan in the other direction from corner to corner. Repeat until the lattice design is formed.","Roll the edges of the crust toward the center of the pan until an even edge is formed and all the ends of the pie crust strips have been concealed.","Brush the crust with beaten egg and sprinkle with sanding sugar.","Bake for 30 minutes or until crust is browned and cherry filling is bubbly."]
