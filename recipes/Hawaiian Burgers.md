prepTime: "20 minutes"
instructions: ["Preheat grill pan or grill until hot for burgers!","Combine ground beef with steak seasoning in a large bowl, using your hands. Divide the meat into 6 equal sized portions. Pat them into patties, a little larger than your slider buns (they will shrink slightly while cooking). Press your thumb into the center of the patty to make an indent.","Heat on hot grill pan for about 4-5 minutes per side (until desired doneness). We like ours medium well done.","To serve, to each burger with a half a slice of pepperjack cheese, a slice of cooked bacon, a little bit of bbq sauce and a dollop of fresh Pineapple Salsa. EAT and enjoy warm!"]
