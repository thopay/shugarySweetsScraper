Mix with your hands in a large bowl until thoroughly blended.","Shape into 12 ovals on two large baking sheets (with 1inch  sides). If making rats, press peas in the front as eyes, and onion in the back as tails.","In a small bowl, whisk together the ketchup, brown sugar and mustard. Spoon over meatloaf.","Bake in a 350 degree oven for about 40-45 minutes.","For the bread, unroll each package of crescent rolls and separate the triangles. Gently roll each triangle into your hand, into a small rope. Carefully tie a knot at the ends of each rope. Place \"bones\" onto parchment paper lined baking sheet. (If you are not making bones, just roll up your crescents as package directs). Bake in a 375 degree oven for 11-13 minutes.","While baking, whisk together the melted butter with garlic and salt. Brush over hot rolls after removing them from the oven and generously sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.  ENJOY"]
