ingredients: ["4 cups powdered sugar","1/2 cup shortening","5-6 Tbsp. milk","1 tsp. vanilla extract","Food coloring (optional)","Sprinkles (optional)","1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened","1/3 cup shortening (I used Crisco)","1/4 cup granulated sugar","1 egg","1 tsp. vanilla extract","1 3/4 cup all-purpose flour","1 tsp. baking powder","1/2 tsp. salt","1/4 cup granulated sugar (to roll the cookie dough in before baking)"]
serves: 36
time: "32 minutes"
prepTime: "20 minutes"
instructions: ["Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Prepare a mini muffin pan by lining it with mini cupcake liners.","In a large bowl, using a hand or stand mixer, beat together the butter, shortening and sugar until it’s smooth and creamy. Add egg and vanilla, mixing JUST until combined.","In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt. Slowly incorporate the flour mixture into the wet ingredients and stir until dough comes together.","Grab about 2 tsp. of cookie dough and roll it into a ball. I used a small cookie scoop and it will resemble the size of a walnut. Roll the ball of dough in a small bowl of sugar, coating all sides, and place it inside of the mini cupcake wrapper.","Gently press down on the tops of the cookie balls so they spread to the edges. If the sugar coating is pressed down into the cookie just sprinkle a little more sugar on the tops.","Bake the cookies for 10-11 minutes; the tops will not change color. The cookies will grow a little in size. I removed them when the tops didn’t look wet any longer and used a toothpick to confirm they were done.","Allow the cookies to cool for a minute in the pan, just so you can handle them, and then move the cookies to a cooling rack to finish cooling.","While the cookies are cooling you can prepare the frosting.","In a large bowl, using a stand or hand mixer, combine the powdered sugar and shortening; mixing until combined. The mixture will be kind of dry and crumbly.","Add in half of the milk, the vanilla and food coloring; mix until the frosting comes together and all of the sugar clumps are gone. If the frosting is too thick, gradually add in the rest of the milk until the desired consistency has been reached.","Once the cookies have been cooled. Fill your piping bag, or use a knife to spread, and frost the cookie bites with the icing and sprinkle with your favorite sprinkles. The shortening in the frosting will allow the frosting to“set”. If you stack the cookie bites they will smoosh a little bit but they will not stick to each other.","Store covered at room temperature."]
