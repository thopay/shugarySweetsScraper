serves: 16
time: "2 hours 27 minutes"
prepTime: "15 minutes"
instructions: ["In a small glass bowl, dissolve sugar and yeast in the water. Let stand until frothy, about 5 to 10 minutes.","In a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer, combine 1 ½  cups of flour with the salt. Pour in the yeast mixture and oil. Stir, or mix on medium-low in mixer, until combined.","Gradually add more flour as you mix until dough pulls away from side of bowl and forms a ball. Knead on a well-floured surface, or with dough hook, adding more flour if needed, until smooth and elastic and no longer sticky, about 7 to 10 minutes.","Place dough in an oiled bowl and cover with a towel or plastic wrap. Allow to rest for about 45 minutes. It will have nearly doubled in size.","Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Carefully roll out dough on a well-floured surface into a 8 - 9 inch wide rectangle. Cut into 10 even sized strips, 8 - 9 inches long. (See Tips for how to get even-sized sticks.) Gently, and ever so slightly, roll strips to make them more rounded.","Place bread sticks on the prepared sheet, about 1.5 to 2 inches apart. Cover and let rest until doubled in size (about 30 minutes).","Preheat oven to 400°F. Bake uncovered for 12 to 14 minutes, until tops are golden brown.","Remove from oven. Brush sticks with melted butter and sprinkle with garlic salt. These are best served warm."]
