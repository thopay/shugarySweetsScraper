serves: 8
time: "8 hours 25 minutes"
prepTime: "15 minutes"
instructions: ["In a food processor, pulse graham crackers (about 10 full size crackers) to make 1 ½ cup crumbs.","Add sugar and melted butter and pulse until blended. Press crumbs into the bottoms of an 8 or 9-inch pie plate. Use the bottom of a cup or the heel of your hand to press firmly (make sure to go up the sides of the plate).","In a mixing bowl, beat the heavy whipping cream until stiff peaks form. Set aside.","In a separate mixing bowl, beat cream cheese, powdered sugar, lemon zest, and lemon juce. Beat until smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.","Using your mixer on low speed, fold the cream mixture into the cream cheese mixture. Do this slowly (or by hand) so you keep the fluffy whipped cream.","Spread into graham cracker crust.","In a large saucepan, whisk cornstarch and sugar until no lumps remain. Add raspberries, water, and lemon juice and stir gently to combine. ","Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently to prevent it from burning, until the mixture thickens and becomes translucent. This will take about 10 minutes. ","Remove from heat. Cool completely before topping the cheesecake. Use a slotted spoon so you don't have extra juices. See notes below.","Referigerate cheesecake for 8 hours, or overnight."]
