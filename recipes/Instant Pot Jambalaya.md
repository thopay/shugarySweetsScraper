serves: 6
time: "1 hour"
prepTime: "20 minutes"
instructions: ["Add 1 Tablespoon of olive oil to the Instant Pot and select the SAUTE function.  When the oil is hot, add the andouille sausage and cook until browned.  Using a wooden spoon, turn the sausage slices until all sides are browned.  This will take about 6 minutes.  Remove the sausage to a plate and set aside.","Add another ½ Tablespoon of olive oil to the pot and add the shrimp.  Cook the shrimp about 3 minutes or until they are no longer translucent.  Remove them from the Instant Pot and add them to the plate with the sausage.","Add the last ½ Tablespoon of olive oil to the pot and add the chopped onion, green bell pepper and red bell pepper.  Cook and stir for about 5 minutes.  Add the garlic, salt, oregano, thyme, cayenne, and bay leaf.  Cook for about 30 seconds.  Turn the Instant Pot off.","Pour in about ½ cup of the chicken broth to deglaze the bottom of the pot.  Use the wooden spoon to scrape any food bits that may be stuck to the bottom of the pot.  This will prevent the burn notice from being alerted.  ","Pour in the remaining broth.  Add the diced tomatoes, but do not stir.  Rinse and drain the rice and add it to the pot.  Using the wooden spoon, gently distribute it in an even layer, and push it down in the liquid.  Add the chicken thighs on top.","Cover the Instant Pot and turn the valve to “sealing.”  Select “High Pressure” and manually set the time to 20 minutes.  After the cooking time is complete, let the pressure naturally release for 15 minutes.  Then do a quick pressure release, and open the lid.","Using a pair of tongs, break up or shred the chicken thighs into bite-sized pieces.  They will be very tender and this should be very easy to do.","Remove the bay leaf.  Stir in the hot sauce, green onions, lemon juices, sausage and shrimp.  Allow the mixture to sit until the sausage and shrimp have been heated through.  Add seasonings to taste.  Serve hot."]
