instructions: ["In small bowl, mix the pumpkin, heavy cream and egg with a whisk. Set aside.","In mixer, using paddle attachment, mix flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and spices. Add in cold butter cubes and mix until crumbly. Slowly add in pumpkin mixture and mix until thoroughly combined. Dough will be crumbly, so you'll need to mix with hands. if it's too sticky, add about 1/4 cup flour until you can manage it easily.","Divide dough in half, and form the dough into a 12x6 inch rectangle. If it’s too sticky, using hands, mix in enough flour so it is easier to shape. I sprinkle my silpat (or counter) with about 1/4-1/2 cup flour).","Cut dough into triangles by making three vertical cuts (you should now have 3 rectangles. Cut each of the rectangles by making an X, I use a pizza cutter. Then make ONE horizontal cut across the center. You should have 18 triangles.","Place each triangle onto a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake in a 425 degree oven for about 13-15 minutes. Repeat with other half of dough.","Cool on rack. Make sugar glaze by whisking the sugar with heavy cream. Using a brush, paint the tops of each scone with the glaze.","To make the cinnamon glaze, whisk all the ingredients together until smooth. Pour into a ziploc bag and cut the corner. Drizzle the glaze over all the scones. Allow to dry (about 15 minutes). Eat and enjoy!"]
