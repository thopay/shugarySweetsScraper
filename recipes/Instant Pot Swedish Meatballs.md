instructions: ["In a large mixing bowl, combine ground beef, ground pork, minced onion, breadcrumbs, seasonings, eggs, and heavy cream. Using your hands, combine ingredients completely until thoroughly mixed.","Roll mixture into 1-inch sized meatballs, packing tightly. Set aside until all the mixture is used. You should be able to make about 75 meatballs.","Add butter to bottom of Instant Pot. Turn on saute. When butter is melted, add one layer of meatballs, cooking about 3 minutes on each side. (They may not be all the way cooked inside, that's okay). Remove cooked meatballs onto a plate and repeat with another layer of meatballs.","When all the meatballs are partially cooked, add the beef broth to the pot. Using a wooden spoon, scrape up any bits and pieces that are stuck to the bottom of the pan. This technique is called \"deglazing\" and it reduces the burn notice tendencies.","Turn off Instant Pot. Return the meatballs to the pot into the beef broth. Sprinkle with 1/2 tsp allspice, and 1/2 tsp kosher salt.","Secure the lid and make sure the valve is set to \"SEALING.\"","Select HIGH PRESSURE and a cook time of 5 minutes. When cook time ends, allow to naturally release for 10 minutes.","While the meatballs are cooking, in a small bowl whisk together flour and water until smooth. Set aside.","After the ten minute natural release of pressure, turn the valve to \"VENTING\" and allow the remaining pressure to release. Open the lid.","Turn the Instant Pot on saute, and add in the heavy whipping cream, flour mixture, 1/2 tsp allspice, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1/2 tsp black pepper. Stir until thickened. This will take about 3-4 minutes.","Turn off and add fresh parsley.","Serve over mashed potatoes or egg noodles!"]
