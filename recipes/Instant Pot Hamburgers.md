time: "28 minutes"
prepTime: "10 minutes"
instructions: ["In a mixing bowl, combine lean ground beef with seasoning blend. I like to use McCormick steak seasoning. I made 5 thick burgers with 2 lbs of meat. Keep your patties the same size for even cooking!","Add some raw onion slices on top of each burger, if desired. My family doesn’t like onions, but it adds flavor during the cooking process (and you can take them off after if you desire).","Wrap each individual burger patty in foil, folding up the sides so that it is completely sealed.","Add one cup of water to the 6qt Instant Pot (2 cups to an 8qt). Place trivet in pot and stack patties in the pressure cooker.","Lock the lid in place and make sure the valve on top is set to “SEALING.”","Select HIGH PRESSURE for a cook time of 18 minutes. (My patties were very large, depending on the size of the burger, you can adjust this time).","After the cook time is done, do a quick release of pressure with the valve.","Carefully remove each foil patty with a pair of tongs.","If you want cheeseburgers, immediately top the warm burgers with cheese allowing it to melt."]
