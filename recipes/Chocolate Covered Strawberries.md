ingredients: ["1 pint ripe strawberries (washed and dried)","1 package (10 ounce) Ghirardelli dark chocolate melting wafers","1 package (10 ounce) Ghirardelli white chocolate melting wafers","1 pint of ripe strawberries (washed and dried)","3 Tablespoons blue sanding sugar sprinkles"]
serves: 20
time: "25 minutes"
prepTime: "5 minutes"
instructions: ["Line a baking sheet with a piece of parchment paper.","In a microwave safe bowl, melt the chocolate wafers according to the package directions. Let the chocolate cool slightly. Dipping the strawberries in hot chocolate can result in a scorched strawberry that is soft.","Holding the strawberry by the stem or leaves, dip it into the chocolate and let the excess run off.","Gently place the strawberry on the parchment lined baking sheet. Repeat until all the strawberries have been dipped. Make sure to allow enough room on the baking sheet so that the strawberries don’t touch while the chocolate sets.","Drizzle with additional melted chocolate if desired. This can be done by putting some melted chocolate in a sandwich bag with the corner cut off for piping or simply drizzling it from a spoon.","Add blue sprinkles to a bowl deep enough to dip the tip of the strawberry into.","Dip about two-thirds of the strawberry into the white chocolate. You want to be able to see a large portion of the red berry at the top.","Hold the strawberry over the dish of white chocolate and allow for all the access to drip off the berry.  This is very important. If the berry has too much white chocolate on it, it will create a bulging effect when it’s dipped into the blue sprinkles. Use an extra piece of parchment and tap the bottom of the berry on it to remove even more of the white chocolate if desired.","Very gently dip the bottom third of the strawberry into the blue sprinkles. You can rotate the strawberry to make sure all sides have an equal line of blue.","Transfer to a baking sheet lined with parchment and allow the chocolate to set."]
