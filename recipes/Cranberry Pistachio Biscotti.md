instructions: ["Preheat oven to 350 degree F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper, set aside.","In a large mixing bowl, beat butter with sugar until combined, about 2 minutes. Add in eggs and vanilla. Slowly add flour and baking powder. Mix until thoroughly blended. Fold in cranberries and pistachios.","On prepared baking sheet, shape dough into a 12 inch by 5 inch rectangle, that is about 1/2 inch thick. I use a little extra flour on my hands to keep the dough from sticking.","Bake for 25 minutes. Remove from oven. Using a pizza cutter or serrated knife, slice biscotti into 12, one inch wide slices. Lay each slice on it's side, separating them on the baking sheet.","Bake an additional 10 minutes. Flip biscotti to opposite side and bake another 10minutes. Remove and cool completely before frosting.","To garnish, dip bottom of cooled biscotti into melted vanilla candy coating. Set on parchment paper (candy coating side DOWN) and allow to dry/set. Once set (about 15 minutes) store in an airtight container or ziploc bag for up to two weeks."]
