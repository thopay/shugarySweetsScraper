instructions: ["Add ingredients IN THIS ORDER to the Instant Pot. DO NOT STIR. Chicken broth, bite size chicken, elbow pasta, diced ham, onion powder, garlic salt, kosher salt, black pepper, and crushed red pepper flakes.","Secure the lid and make sure the valve on top is set to “SEALING“. Select HIGH PRESSURE and a cook time of 9 minutes (this does not include the time it takes to come to pressure).","While the chicken cordon bleu is cooking in the pressure cooker, take two slices of white bread and process them into crumbs in a food processor (or blender).","In a skillet, melt 2 Tbsp of unsalted butter. Add bread crumbs and stir constantly, until crumbs are golden brown (about 5-6 minutes).","Season breadcrumbs with salt and pepper (if desired) and set aside until the pasta is cooked.","When the cook time ends, allow to naturally release for 10 minutes (this means don’t touch it). After ten minutes, move the valve on top to “RELEASE” and allow any remaining pressure inside to release.","Open the lid and stir in the heavy whipping cream, bacon crumbles, and cheese. Stir well until everything is combined and cheese is melted! Serve with toasted breadcrumbs and enjoy!"]
