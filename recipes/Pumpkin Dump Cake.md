instructions: ["Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. You'll need a greased and floured 13x9 baking dish. I like to use baking spray for this cake.","To make the pumpkin base, in a large bowl, combine canned pumpkin, evaporated milk, spices, sugar, and eggs. Mix until well blended. Pour the pumpkin mixture into your prepared baking dish.","Next up, sprinkle a package of dry yellow cake mix over the top, spreading evenly. Top with chopped pecans and drizzle with melted butter. You can also skip melting the butter and just place cubes of butter on top.","Bake for about 45-50 minutes. You can serve this cake warm with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. However, I love enjoying this cake cold with a little whipped topping and caramel sauce drizzled over the top!"]
