ingredients: ["1 cup graham cracker crumbs (1 sleeve of crackers, 9 full size)","2 Tablespoons granulated sugar","5 Tablespoons melted butter","2 packages (8 ounce each) cream cheese, room temperature","2/3 cup granulated sugar","1 teaspoon vanilla extract","2 Tablespoons all-purpose flour","3 large eggs, room temperature","1/4 cup sour cream","1/4 cup heavy whipping cream","1 can (20 ounce) cherry pie filling"]
serves: 8
time: "55 minutes"
prepTime: "15 minutes"
instructions: ["In a food processor, pulse graham crackers until fine crumbs. Add in melted butter and granulated sugar. Pulse until combined.","Press crumbs into the bottom and partially up the sides of a 7-inch springform pan. Refrigerate until filling is ready.","In a large mixing bowl, combine cream cheese and granulated sugar. Beat until smooth and creamy.","Add in vanilla extract, flour and the eggs, one at a time. Do not over beat the mixture. Beat JUST until the last egg is incorporated, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. ","Add the sour cream and heavy whipping cream, stirring until blended.","Pour filling into chilled graham cracker crust.","Wrap the top of the cheesecake in foil. Then place the cheesecake on a second piece of foil, wrapping the sides up over the top. ","Fill the pressure cooker with 1 cup of water. Place the foil wrapped springform pan on the trivet (I use the one that came with my pressure cooker) and lower it into the instant pot.","Secure the lid, turn valve to \"SEALING\" and turn on the pressure cooker.","Set to high pressure for 40 minutes.","When the cheesecake is done, allow to naturally release pressure completely. This takes about 20-30 minutes.","Remove cheesecake from the Instant Pot by lifting the trivet with the handles. Allow cheesecake to cool to room temperature.","Place cheesecake in refrigerator to chill overnight, or at least 8 hours.","After chilling, remove foil from cheesecake and gently blot off any condensation from top of cheesecake with a paper towel.","Use a knife and run it along the sides of the pan to gently remove cheesecake from pan.","Push bottom of cheesecake pan up to lift the cheesecake out of the pan (or unhinge the buckle if yours has that). ","Top chilled cheesecake with cherry pie filling and serve cold. ENJOY."]
