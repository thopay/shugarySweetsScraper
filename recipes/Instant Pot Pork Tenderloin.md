instructions: ["In a small bowl, combine salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. Rub olive oil over tenderloins and season with seasoning mix.","Set pressure cooker to \"SAUTE.\" Add pressed garlic and tenderloins to the pot. Brown the meat, turning every 1-2 minutes until tenderloins have browned (this took about 6 minutes).","Remove the meat from the pot and add 1 cup of water. Using a wooden spoon, deglaze the bottom of the instant pot by scraping up the browned bits of meat, while still on saute. Press cancel.","Add in soy sauce, brown sugar and balsamic vinegar. Whisk together with the water in the pot and add the pork tenderloins back to the Instant Pot.","Lock the lid in place, making sure the venting valve is set to \"SEALING.\"","Select HIGH PRESSURE for a cook time of 10 minutes.","When the cook time is done, allow the food to naturally release pressure for 10 minutes (this means don't touch a thing)! Then, turn the valve to venting, and do a quick release of pressure. Remove the lid and place the pork on a cutting board.","While the pork rests on the cutting board, turn the instant pot back on \"SAUTE.\"","In a small bowl, whisk together the corn starch with remaining 1/4 cup cold water. Add to the pot and cook for about 2 minutes, whisking until thick and bubbly.","Slice the pork tenderloin and drizzle the balsamic glaze over the top. ENJOY."]
