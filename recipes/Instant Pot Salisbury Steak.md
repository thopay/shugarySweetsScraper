instructions: ["In a mixing bowl, combine ground beef with garlic powder, salt, bread crumbs, egg, Worcestershire sauce, and diced onion. Use a wooden spoon (or your hands) to combine the mixture and form thick patties (about 4-5 patties).","Turn the Instant Pot on \"Saute\" and cook the beef patties for about 3-4 minutes per side. Remove and place on a plate, then cover with foil. Set aside.","Add butter to the bottom of the Instant Pot. While still on sauted, add the mushrooms and sliced onions. Cook until tender (several minutes), then add in the garlic. Cook an additional minute.","Pour in beef broth and 1/2 cup of water. Using a wooden spoon, deglaze the bottom of the pan by scraping up the bits of cooked meat and vegetable. Turn saute off.","Stir in the Worcesterhire, mustard, and bouillon. Add the beef patties back into the Instant Pot and secure the lid in place. Make sure the vent is set to SEALING.","Set Instant Pot to Manual (or high pressure) for a cook time of 2 minutes. When cook time ends, allow to naturally release pressure for 10 ninutes, then move the valve to VENTING to do a quick release of any remaining pressure.","Remove the patties back to a plate. In a small bowl, combine the remaining 1/2 cup water with cornstarch. Add to the Instant Pot to make a slurry. Set to SAUTE and whisk until the gravy thickens.","Place meat on a serving platter and pour gravy over the top. Serve and enjoy."]
