instructions: ["Prepare the tzatziki sauce first, ahead of time. I prefer to make my sauce in morning, and allowing it to sit in the fridge all day until dinner. The longer time it has to sit, the better the flavor. But don't worry, if you forgot to make it ahead of time, it will still taste amazing.","For the sauce, combine all the ingredients in a bowl, then cover and refrigerate for 4 hours. Be sure to dice your onions and cucumbers SMALL.","Preheat oven to 375°F. Line a baking sheet with non stick foil. Set aside.","In a large skillet, drizzle olive oil and heat over medium high heat. Add garlic and saute for about 1 minute. Add in shredded zucchini.","Cook for about 5 minutes, until most of the water in the skillet has evaporated. Transfer to a colander and press out remaining liquid.","In a large bowl combine bread crumbs, egg, seasonings, and parmesan cheese. Mix with the zucchini until fully blended.","Using a 2Tbsp scoop, form 20 balls, rolling tightly, and transfer to prepared baking sheet. Bake for about 20-25 minutes, until firm and lightly browned.","Serve meatballs with tzatziki sauce on a pita! ENJOY!"]
