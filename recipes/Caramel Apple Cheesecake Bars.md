instructions: ["Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 9-inch square baking dish with foil. Set aside.","In a food processor, process cookies until fine crumb.

Press into the bottom of your prepared dish.","Bake crust for about 8 minutes, remove and cool while preparing cheesecake filling (doesn't need to be cooled completely).","For the filling, combine white chocolate chips and heavy cream in a microwave safe bowl. Heat one minute and stir until melted and smooth (heat additional 15 seconds if needed). Set aside.","In a mixer, combine cream cheese with sugar and cornstarch and beat until fluffy, about 3-4 minutes. Beat in sour cream, eggs, vanilla, and spices. Slowly beat in white chocolate mixture. Pour over prepared crust. Top with diced apples. Set aside.","In a bowl, combine streusel ingredients and mix with hands until crumbly. Sprinkle over apples. Return to oven and bake for 40 minutes. Center may be slightly jiggly. Cool completely then refrigerate for at least 3 hours (or overnight).","When ready to serve, cut into bars and drizzle with caramel sauce. ENJOY!"]
