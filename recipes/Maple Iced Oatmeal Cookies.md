prepTime: "15 minutes"
instructions: ["In a food processor (or blender), add oatmeal and pulse until partially ground. Don't make into a fine powder. I pulsed mine 6-8 times, for about 1-2 seconds each time. Set aside.","Preheat oven to 350 degree F.","In a large mixing bowl, blend together melted butter with sugars. Mix for several minutes until well combined. Add in eggs and maple flavoring. Add cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, baking soda, baking powder, oats and flour. Mix until thoroughly blended.","Drop by large scoop (I use a 2 Tbsp scoop) onto a parchment paper lined cookie sheet. Bake for about 14-16 minutes (I tend to go closer to 16 for a little extra crunch when they cool). Remove from oven and cool on pan 3 minutes, then cool completely on wire rack.","For the glaze, whisk together the sugar, maple and milk until smooth. Spoon over each cool cookie and allow to harden (about 15 minutes). ENJOY!"]
