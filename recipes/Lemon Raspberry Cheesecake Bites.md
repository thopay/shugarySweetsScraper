Remove and cool while preparing cheesecake filling.","For the filling, heat heavy cream in a double boiler over low heat. Add in white chocolate and stir continuously until chips are melted. Remove from heat and set aside.","In mixer, beat cream cheese with sugar and cornstarch until fluffy. Beat in sour cream, eggs and vanilla extract. Slowly beat in heavy cream mixture.
