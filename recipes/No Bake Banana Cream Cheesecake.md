Refrigerate for 5 minutes, until ready to assemble.","Lightly grease the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan with baking spray. Set aside.","In a food processor, grind the vanilla wafers (reserving about 6 of them for the garnish) until a fine crumb. Add in the melted butter and combine together with a fork.","Pour crust mixture into bottom of springform pan and press firmly to create a thick crust! Set aside.","Beat cream cheese with sugar for 3-4 minutes until light and fluffy. Add in whipping cream and vanilla and beat an additional 2-3 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.","Pour cheesecake filling into prepared crust.","Once you have poured your cheesecake filling onto your crust, add your sliced bananas to the top of the cheesecake.","Get your pudding mixture out of the refrigerator and pour that over the sliced bananas.","Top everything with 8 oz of the thawed Cool Whip.","Refrigerate entire cake for at least 3 hours.","When ready to serve, useÂ your 6 reserved cookies and crush them.
