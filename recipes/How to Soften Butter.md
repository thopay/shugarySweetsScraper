instructions: ["Counter. The first and easiest method of softening butter is to take it out ahead of time. How quickly this method will work depends on the temperature of the room. A stick of butter will take approximately 1-2 hours to soften. ","Cut the butter into smaller pieces. Cut the stick of butter lengthwise and then repeat so that the stick has been cut into quarters. Then, cut the stick into cubes that are ½” or smaller. This method will reduce softening time to 10-15 minutes depending on the size of the cubes.","Grate the butter. Using the large size of a box or hand-held grater, using the wrapper to grasp the stick, run the stick of butter in one direction down the grate. Many pastry recipes, including those for scones, advise this method for incorporating the butter with the other ingredients. The butter will be softened in less than 5 minutes using this method.","Heating it with an overturned container, such as a mason jar. Fill a quart size mason jar, or measuring cup with water. Microwave the container for 2 minutes. Carefully pour out the water and set the butter, still in the wrapper, on its end so that it stands vertically. Place the cup over the stick of butter and leave it for about 5-10 minutes. The heat from the container will be released gently surround the stick of butter and soften it. At the end of this time, remove the container and check the butter. It may be softer on the outside than in the core of the stick.","Pound the butter flat. - Place the stick of butter between two large pieces of plastic wrap. Using a rolling pin or kitchen mallet, pound the butter into a flat sheet, about 1/8th” thick. Let rest for about 5 minutes or until desired softness is achieved. Carefully peel the plastic wrap away from the butter while folding the sheet of butter."]
