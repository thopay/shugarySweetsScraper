instructions: ["Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Line cupcake tin with paper cupcake liners. Set aside.","In a mixing bowl, combine sugar, cake flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Add in butter, and mix on medium speed for 2-3 minutes until well blended. Set aside.","In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs, ricotta cheese, vanilla and milk. Add egg mixture to flour mixture and beat on medium until smooth and combined.","Fill cupcake liners about 2/3 full. Bake for 18-20 minutes and remove to cooling rack when done. Cool completely before adding lemon curd and frosting.","When cool, cut a small circle around the middle of the top of each cupcake, going down about 3/4 of the way into the cupcake creating small cylinders. Remove the cylinders and set aside. Fill each cupcake with 1 Tbsp of lemon curd.","Press the cylinders lightly on top of each cupcake. Don't worry if they don't fit perfectly as you will be adding frosting to the top!","For the frosting, beat butter until light and fluffy, about two minutes. Add in powdered sugar, milk, and lemon extract. Beat for an additional 3-5 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.","Use a 2 Tbsp cookie scoop to top each cupcake with frosting. Spread evenly over the top and immediately press the coconut into the frosting, gently. Store in covered container in the refrigerator until ready to eat, and enjoy!"]
