ingredients: ["8 oz cream cheese, softened","1/2 cup powdered sugar","1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract","1 1/4 cup salted butter, softened","1 cup light brown sugar, packed","1/2 cup granulated sugar","2 teaspoons vanilla extract","2 large eggs","2 3/4 cup all-purpose flour","1 teaspoon baking soda","2 cups mini semi-sweet chocolate chip morsels"]
serves: 24
time: "2 hours 2 minutes"
prepTime: "20 minutes"
instructions: ["Make the cookie dough by beating the softened butter with both sugars for several minutes, until fully blended.","Add in vanilla and eggs. Beat until combined.","Add flour and baking soda, mixing just until blended. Fold in chocolate chips.","Chill cookie dough in refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.","For the filling, beat cream cheese, powdered sugar, and vanilla until fully combined, about 3-4 minutes. Chill in refrigerator until ready to use.","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.","Using a 2 Tablespoon cookie scoop, scoop cookie dough into palm of your hand and flatten into a circle (about 2-inches to 2 1/2-inches). Place on parchment paper at least 4 inches apart (I put 4 cookies on a sheet at a time).","Using a small scoop, drop about 1 Tablespoon of cheesecake filling into the center of each cookie dough circle. Using the 2 Tablespoon scoop, grab another scoop of cookie dough, flatten in your hand and place gently over the cheesecake.","Pick up the entire cookie and press edges together so that cheesecake doesn't come out. Place back on cookie sheet. Repeat for remaining cookies. Press a few extra chocolate chips on top, before baking, if desired.","Bake in preheated oven for 12-14 minutes. The cookies will have lightly golden edges, but be sure to not OVERBAKE them. You want them a little soft in the center (I always err on undercooking vs overcooking).","Allow cookies to sit on cookie sheet for 5-8 minutes to cool (they will continue to cook slightly) and then remove them to cool completely on a wire rack.","Refrigerate cookies for at least one hour before serving for best flavor!"]
