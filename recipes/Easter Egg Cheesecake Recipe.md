serves: 8
time: "4 hours 15 minutes"
prepTime: "15 minutes"
instructions: ["Line the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan with parchment paper. Set aside.","In a large bowl combine melted butter, graham cracker crumbs, and granulated sugar. Mix with a fork. ","After its fully mixed, transfer the crumb mixture to the springform pan,  pressing down firmly to form a crust. ","Flatten it against the parchment paper until it’s even. ","Place the crust in the fridge while you make the filling.","In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese with sweetened milk, vanilla extract, and lemon juice for 3-4 minutes until smooth and fluffy. Fold in Cool Whip with a spatula.","Remove crust from fridge and carefully pour half of the cheesecake filling on top of the crust. ","With a spatula evenly spread it to cover the whole crust.","To make the Blue layer: Combine the remaining half of cheesecake filling with 2-3 drops of blue gel food coloring.","Using a hand mixer whisk together well, until it's fully combined.","Spread evenly on top of the white cheesecake layer. It doesn’t need to fully cover the top.","Place half of your Robin’s Eggs in a ziploc bag. Using a kitchen mallet carefully beat the bag a few times so that you have large pieces of the Robin’s Eggs. Set aside. ","Take a fork and gently dip it in the unsweetened cocoa powder. Then sprinkle speckles of the unsweetened cocoa powder on top of the cheesecake.","Top it with the whole Robin’s Egg Malt Balls, starting at the center and working your way out.","Finally, add the Robin Egg pieces on the top of that - to balance it all out. ","Place it in the fridge for about 4-6 hours, longer is better. You could put it in the fridge overnight at this point as well, just cover loosely with foil or plastic wrap. The longer it stays in the fridge before serving the more solid it will be! ","Remove springform pan right before serving. ENJOY."]
