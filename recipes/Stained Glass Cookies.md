serves: 24
time: "2 hours 45 minutes"
prepTime: "30 minutes"
instructions: ["In a large mixing bowl, beat the butter, sugar, vanilla, almond extract, and salt until light in color and well blended.","Add in the egg and mix until completely combined.","Slowly add in the flour and baking powder just until combined, do not overbeat the dough.","Divide the cookie dough into two equally size balls. Place one ball on a sheet of parchment paper and roll the dough to 1/4-inch thickness. Repeat with the second ball of dough.","Cover the two sheets of rolled out cookie dough with plastic wrap and chill for up to 2 hours (or overnight).","While the dough is chilling, crush candies in ziploc bags, separately by color. Set aside.","When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper, set aside.","Using two cookie cutters of different sizes but same shapes, cut the large cookie first. Then use the smaller cookie cutter on the center of the large cut out cookie (you can bake the center cookie separately with sugar on top to enjoy plain). Place large cookie on a cookie sheet, about 2-inches apart (do not leave the cut out in the center of the cookie or they will bake together).","Repeat with the remaining dough.","Put a small amount of the crushed jolly rancher into the center of each cut out cookie.","Bake for 12-15 minutes, until the candy centers have completely melted and the edges of the cookies are slightly browned.","Remove cookies from oven and allow to cool on cookie sheet for ten minutes, then remove and cool completely on a wire rack."]
