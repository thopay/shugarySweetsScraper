instructions: ["Grease and flour two 9-inch (standard size loaf pans). Or use a baking spray. Preheat oven to 325 degree F.","In a large bowl, beat eggs with oil, sugar, vanilla extract and almond extract, and milk. Add in flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder, and cinnamon. Mix until well blended.","Fold in shredded zucchini and chopped walnuts. Pour batter into two loaf pans.","In a small bowl, combine streusel ingredients. I find it easiest to use my hands to combine the ingredients into a crumbly mixture, making sure the butter is completely blended into the streusel.","Sprinkle the streusel evenly onto the two pans of batter. Press lightly.","Bake in preheatedÂ oven for about 60 minutes. Remove and cool in pans about ten minutes.
