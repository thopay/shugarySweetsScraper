instructions: ["Place pork in a large crockpot. Sprinkle generously with the coarse sea salt. Drizzle the liquid smoke over the pork. Cover and cook on low for at least 8 hours.","When pork is fully cooked, shred into large chunks and serve hot. If making a sandwich, you can shred the pork a little smaller. We like to eat the pork in large chunks the first day and make sandwiches with the leftovers.","In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, olive oil and sugar.","Place broccoli slaw mix (found in the bagged salad section of the grocery store) in a medium bowl. Add crushed pineapple. Drizzle with dressing. Stir until combined. Refrigerate for at least an hour (more is better)!","Serve slaw on the side with the pork. Or add it on top of your sandwich!"]
