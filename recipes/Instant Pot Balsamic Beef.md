instructions: ["In a small bowl, combine the salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning.","Cut chuck roast into 4 chunks. Rub with olive oil and press seasoning blend all over the meat.","Set pressure cooker to “SAUTE” and add beef and garlic to the pot. Brown the meat, turning every couple of minutes to brown all sides.","Remove the meat from the pot and deglaze.","To deglaze, add beef broth to the bottom of the pot. Using a wooden spoon, scrape the bottom until all the bits of browned meat are removed.","To the beef broth, add brown sugar, soy sauce, and balsamic vinegar. Whisk together and add the meat back to the Instant Pot.","Lock the lid in place and make sure the valve on top is set to “SEALING.”","Select HIGH PRESSURE for a cook time of 75 minutes.","When the cook time is done, allow to naturally release pressure for 10 minutes, then turn the valve on top to “VENTING” to do a quick release of pressure.","Remove the lid and place the beef on a cutting board to shred.","If you want a thicker “gravy” style sauce, remove all but 1 1/4 cup of liquid from the bottom of the instant pot.","In a small bowl whisk together 1/4 cup cold water with 2 Tbsp cornstarch.","Turn the Instant Pot on “saute” and add the cornstarch slurry to the pot. Whisk until bubbly and thickened.","Shred the beef and serve the sauce over the top or on the side!"]
