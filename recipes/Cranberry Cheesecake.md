Pour in the melted butter and mix to combine.    ","Add 2/3 of the mixture to a 9” round spring-form pan and press into the bottom and sides. Tip: use the back of a measuring cup to press down and help make a smooth bottom. Reserve the remaining 1/3 of the mixture for the crumb topping.","Combine the cream cheese, ricotta cheese and granulated sugar in a stand mixer. Beat until the sugar has dissolved. Beat in the eggs, vanilla, lemon zest, fresh lemon juice and melted butter to combine. Stir in the salt and all-purpose flour.","Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula, as needed, and continue stirring until the mixture is smooth. Tip: This can also be done in a food processor.   ","Pour the cheesecake batter into the crust. Refrigerate while you pre-heat the oven to 325 degrees.    ","Place dollops of the cranberry swirl mixture on top of the batter and swirl in using a butter knife.    ","Bake for 30 minutes.   ","Using the remainder of the crust dough, form small clumps with your hands and sprinkle on top of the cheesecake.If you prefer to let the swirl show, just sprinkle the crumbs along the edges. Return to the oven for an additional 45 to 50 minutes.    ","The cheesecake is done when there’s a slight jiggle in the middle but is otherwise set. Allow to cool completely before removing from the pan. Top with the sugared cranberries before serving.","Add the water and ½ cup of the granulated sugar to a pot on low heat. Cook for a few minutes, just until the sugar has melted. Remove from the heat and stir in the cranberries.    ","Using a slotted spoon, remove the cranberries and place them on a wire rack, set over a pan, for a few minutes to cool.","Add the remaining cup of sugar to a large dish and toss the cranberries in the sugar until well coated."]
