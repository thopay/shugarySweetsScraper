ingredients: ["1 cup salted butter, softened","¾ cup brown sugar, packed","¼ cup granulated sugar","2 large eggs","1 teaspoon vanilla extract","2 ½ cups all-purpose flour","1 teaspoon baking soda","½ cup graham cracker crumbs","1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips","1 cup milk chocolate chips","1 ½ - 2 cups mini marshmallows"]
serves: 20
time: "27 minutes"
prepTime: "15 minutes"
instructions: ["Preheat oven to 350℉. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Set aside.","With an electric mixer, beat butter and sugars until light and fluffy. Add eggs and vanilla and beat well. Add flour and baking soda half at a time, until well combined.","Fold in graham cracker crumbs and chocolate chips, reserving some chips to press into the tops of the cookies.","Using a 1 Tablespoon cookie scoop, scoop cookie dough into the palm of your hand and flatten into a circle (about 2-inches to 2 ½-inches). Place on parchment paper at least 4 inches apart (I put 4 cookies on a sheet at a time).","Place 5-7 mini marshmallows onto the center of each cookie dough circle. Using the 1 Tablespoon scoop, grab another scoop of cookie dough, flatten in your hand and place gently over the mini marshmallows.","Press edges of the top and bottom discs together so that melted marshmallow doesn't come out when baking. Repeat for remaining cookies. Press a few extra mini marshmallows and chocolate chips on top, before baking, if desired.","Bake in a preheated oven for 12-14 minutes. The cookies will have lightly golden edges, but be sure to not OVERBAKE them. You want them a little soft in the center (I always err on undercooking vs overcooking).","Cool on the cookie sheet until the cookies can be transferred to a cooling rack without breaking apart, about 10-15 minutes."]
