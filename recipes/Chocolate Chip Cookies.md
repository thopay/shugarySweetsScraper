time: "28 minutes"
prepTime: "15 minutes"
instructions: ["Preheat oven to 350F. Line cookie sheets with parchment paper.","In a large mixing bowl, combine butter and sugars for about 2 minutes, until fully blended. Add in eggs and vanilla and beat until well mixed.","Add in flour, salt, and baking soda. Beat JUST until fully combined. Fold in 2 cups chocolate chips.","Using a 3 Tablespoon cookie scoop, drop onto parchment paper lined baking sheets about 2 inches apart. Press some of the reserved chocolate chips into the top of the cookies (I do about 7-8 chips).","Bake for 11-13 minutes, until outside of cookie is lightly browned. Remove from oven and allow to cool several minutes on baking sheet. Remove and cool completely on wire rack. The number of cookies is determined by the size scoop you use. I prefer these to be larger...which yields about 2 dozen cookies."]
