instructions: ["Place oven rack in the center position and preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line your baking pan with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper.","In a small bowl, mix flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.","In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, place the butter, cream cheese, white sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract. Mix on medium speed for approximately 1-2 minutes until thoroughly combined, and batter clings to the side of the bowl.","With a spatula, scrape down the side of the bowl and add the whole egg. Mix on medium speed until combined. Add the egg yolk and mix until combined. Scrape the bowl again with the spatula and add the red food coloring and mix on low speed until fully incorporated.","Add the flour mixture a little at a time and mix at a low speed just until they are combined.","Add 1 ½ cups white chocolate chips to the dough and mix until chips are evenly distributed. Reserve the remaining half cup of chips to use after the cookies bake.","To shape the cookies into balls, wet hands and slightly dry them on a paper towel. With your moist hands, roll 1-inch balls of dough and place them on your prepared baking pan.","Place the baking pan in the oven and bake for 9-11 minutes or until the cookies’ edges are crisp. The center can be slightly soft. The cookies will puff up while baking.","Once out of the oven, while the cookies are still warm, press several white chocolate chips into the top of each cookie. Let the cookies cool on the baking pan for 5 minutes and then move to a wire rack to cool completely."]
