prepTime: "15 minutes"
instructions: ["In a medium mixing bowl, whisk flour, cinnamon, baking soda, salt and cornstarch together. Set aside.","In a large bowl, combine butter and brown sugar together with a hand mixer on high speed for about 2 minutes. Scrape the sides of the bowl as needed. Add the eggs and vanilla and beat for another minute.","Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and beat on low, just until combined. Add in the old-fashioned oats and combine on low speed. Fold in the shredded carrots and raisins.","Cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.","Preheat oven to 350℉. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Set aside.","Drop cookie dough by about 2-3 Tablespoons of dough onto the baking sheet. ","Bake for 11-13 minutes. Don’t overbake. The edges will start to brown first. The middle of the cookie may seem like it’s underbaked, but it will continue to bake when it’s taken out of the oven.","Remove the cookies from the oven and allow them to sit on the baking sheet for an additional 5 minutes. Transfer them to a wire rack to finish cooling.","If desired, make a half batch of my homemade cream cheese frosting. Spread over cooled cookies and sprinkle with walnuts."]
