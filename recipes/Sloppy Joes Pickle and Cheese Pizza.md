instructions: ["Preheat oven to 425 degree F.","For the crust: In a large bowl, combine 2 cup of all-purpose flour, undissolved yeast, sugar and salt. Add very warm water and oil, mixing until well blended. (I used my electric mixer with paddle attachment). Gradually add the remaining flour to make a soft dough. The dough should form a ball and will be slightly sticky.","Knead dough on a floured surface until smooth and elastic, for about 4 minutes (I used my electric mixer with dough hook attachment for this part instead, it worked great!!). Divide dough in half and cover with a clean dry towel until toppings are ready.","Cook and crumble the ground beef in a large skillet over medium high heat. Drain off the excess grease and return meat to the skillet. Add seasonings, water, and tomato sauce, mixing until fully blended. Simmer on low heat for 2-3 minutes.","Pat each portion of dough with floured hands to make a 12inch round pizza (using a baking pizza stone or round pizza pan). Form a rim by pinching the edge of the dough.","Spread half of the warm Sloppy Joe mixture onto pizza crust. Top with half the mozzarella and half the cheddar cheese. Sprinkle half the diced pickles over the pizza. Repeat with the second pizza.","Bake in oven for 18-20 minutes, until cheese is bubbly and melted and the crust is browned.Slice and enjoy immediately!!"]
