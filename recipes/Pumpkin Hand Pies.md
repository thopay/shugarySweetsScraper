instructions: ["Preheat over to 425°F. Remove pie crusts from package and allow to come to room temperature while you prepare the filling.","In a small bowl, whisk together the pumpkin puree, brown sugar, allspice, and cinnamon. Fold in chopped Fisher Nuts Walnuts. Set aside.","Unroll pie crusts and cut 6 circles from each crust using a 4 -inch biscuit cutter. Re-roll the scraps to get more circles.","Using a 1 Tbsp cookie scoop, drop pumpkin filling into center of each pie crust circle. Fold in half and pinch edges completely, Fold pinched edges over and using a fork, press the tines of the fork to seal. Poke hand pies with a fork once, to prevent bursting.","Beat egg white in a small bowl until frothy and brush over the tops of each hand pie.
