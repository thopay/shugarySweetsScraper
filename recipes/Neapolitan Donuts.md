prepTime: "15 minutes"
instructions: ["In a large mixing bowl, combine dry ingredients. Add eggs, milk, vanilla and melted butter. Beat for several minutes until well blended.","Spray a donut pan with baking spray. Fill each donut cavity about 3/4 full (I use a large ziploc bag and snip off the corner to do this neatly). Makes about 10 donuts.","Bake in a 325 degree oven for 10-12 minutes. Allow to cool slightly and remove from pan onto a wire rack.","While the donuts are baking, make the frosting. In a small saucepan on medium-low heat, combine the cream, milk, butter, vanilla, and gelatin powder. Heat until butter is completely melted. Turn heat to low. Add in 3 ounce of the white chocolate. Stir constantly until the white chocolate is melted and blended. Remove from heat.","Add powdered sugar 1/2 cup at a time, whisking between each addition until desired consistency (using the 1 1/2 cup as a guide).","Dip cooled donuts into strawberry frosting and place on parchment paper. Melt remaining 1 oz white chocolate in a small bowl for 30-45 seconds in the microwave (stirring once halfway through). Place white chocolate in a small ziploc bag and snip off the corner. Drizzle over strawberry frosting and add sprinkles immediately. ENJOY"]
