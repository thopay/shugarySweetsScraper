ingredients: ["1 cup skim milk","½ cup heavy whipping cream","⅓ cup unsalted butter","⅓ cup warm water","2 packages active yeast","2 large eggs","¼ cup sugar","1½ teaspoon kosher salt","1 teaspoon ground nutmeg","4½ cups all-purpose flour","Vegetable Oil for frying","1 cup granulated sugar, for coating","1 cup raspberry preserves, for filling"]
serves: 36
time: "3 hours"
prepTime: "2 hours"
instructions: ["Heat milk, cream and butter in small saucepan until melted completely. Put aside to cool to lukewarm.","Pour warm water in mixer bowl (make sure bowl is warm). Sprinkle yeast over water. Let set for about 5 minutes until bubbly. Add the lukewarm butter mixture. Combine.","Add eggs, sugar, salt and nutmeg. Add 2 cups of the flour. Mix using paddle attachment until flour is incorporated (on low speed). Turn up to medium and beat until well combined. Add remaining flour in ½ cup increments. Change to dough hook attachment and beat on medium for about 3-4 minutes. Batter will be VERY sticky.","Transfer to a well-oiled bowl, cover and let rise for about one hour.","On floured surface, roll dough to about ½ inch thick. Try to do as little rolling as possible, and not pressing the rolling pin hard, be gentle. Cut using a 2-3 inch cookie cutter. I used a Halloween candy corn shape to get the triangles, but circles would be fine too! Set doughnuts on floured surface to rise, for about 30-60 minutes (covered).","Preheat oil in stainless skillet or saucepan (I use the skillet). When oil is hot, place doughnuts in oil for about 2-4 minutes on each side, until browned. Transfer to a bowl with granulated sugar and immediately coat them generously. Place on cooling rack.","Once all doughnuts are cooked and cooled, I stir my jam until it's almost runny, then put it in a pastry bag with a an open tip. Stick it in one end of the doughnut and squeeze. You'll see the doughnut puff up, you want to remove before the doughnut explodes, or before the jam starts coming out of the entry hole! This may take a few trial attempts (which means, you may need to cut open a few to see if your \"pressure\" is enough or too much)!","Store doughnuts at room temperature in covered container. Or freeze until later. Thaw at room temperature and enjoy (you may need to re-dip in sugar if they are sticky."]
