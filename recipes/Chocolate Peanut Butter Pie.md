Slowly pour in the melted butter while running the food processor at low speed untilthe cookie crumbs pull away from the edges of the food processor.","Press the cookie crumbs firmly into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie plate. Place in the freezer while preparing pie.","To make the chocolate ganache, put the chocolate into a heat-proof bowl. Set aside.","Add the heavy whipping cream and tablespoon of butter to a small saucepan and heat over medium-low heat until the butter has melted and the cream starts to simmer, but do not let it reach a boil.","Remove the cream from the heat, and pour it over the chopped chocolate. Let the mixture stand for 2 minutes, then stir it until it is well-mixed and smooth. Refrigerate for aboue 30 minutes while you make the filling for the pie.","While the ganache is cooling, make the peanut butter pie filling. In a large bowl, beat together the cream cheese, peanut butter, and sugar with mixer at medium speed until well-combined.","Fold in the thawed whipped topping with a wooden spoon or spatula until just mixed. Spoon the filling into the frozen crust, and smooth out the top with a spatula.","Chill pie in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, the ganache should be cooled and thickened. Pour it over the peanut butter filling and either smooth it out with a spoon or spatula or using the back of a spoon, make a large swirl in the ganache.","Place pie in the refrigerator for at least another 2 hours or until the pie has set. Serve chilled."]
