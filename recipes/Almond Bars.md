instructions: ["Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Generously butter (or use baking spray) on a half sheet pan (approximatedly 18\"x13\"). Set aside.","In a medium bowl, combine flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.","In a mixing bowl, beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 3-4 minutes. Add in eggs and almond extract. Beat until combined. Slowly add in flour mixture. Mixing until well blended.","Press this dough into the bottom of your prepared baking dish. Use your fingers or a pastry roller to smooth the top of the dough.","Using a pastry brush, brush the milk to the top of the dough (you may not need to use all of it). Sprinkle with sliced almonds, pressing them lightly into the dough.","Bake for 20-22 minutes until done. You don't want to brown these bars.","Cool for about 5 minutes, then cut them with a knife into bars. If they are too soft to cut, allow to cool a little bit more. Carefully remove them to a wire rack to continue cooling.","Once cooled, you can make your glaze by whisking the sugar with the almond extract and milk. Drizzle over the bars and allow to set.","Enjoy!"]
