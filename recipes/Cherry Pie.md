serves: 8
time: "1 hour 30 minutes"
prepTime: "30 minutes"
instructions: ["In a large saucepan combine cherries, granulated sugar, lemon juice, cornstarch, cinnamon and almond extract.  Mixture will be very thick, especially if using fresh cherries.  Heat over medium heat and bring to a boil, stirring frequently.  Reduce heat and cook on low for 8-10 minutes or until mixture has thickened and is a gel-like consistency  Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly completely before pouring into the prepared pie crust. ","On a lightly floured surface, roll out bottom pie crust and lay it in a 9-inch pie plate. The crust should drape over each edge by about one inch. Brush the bottom of the crust with the egg white. Pour the cooled filling into the crust.   ","To make the lattice top crust, roll out the second pie crust until it is about ⅛” thickness.  Cut the crust into 12 strips of equal width. Lay 6 strips across the top of the pie, all going in the same direction and evenly spaced. ","Fold every other strip back half way.  Lay one of the remaining 6 strips of pie crust perpendicular across the middle of the pie and unfold the other strips of crust so they lay across the perpendicular strip that was just placed on the pie.  Now fold the other 3 strips back and lay the next perpendicular strip across the pie. ","Repeat the process until the entire top of the pie is covered with the lattice weave.  Roll the excess pie crust on the edges toward the middle to form a nice neat edge.  Combine an egg and a Tablespoon of water to make an egg wash and brush it over the crust.  Sprinkle with coarse sugar, if desired.","Bake at 425 for 10 minutes and then reduce the oven temperature to 375 and bake for 45-50 minutes.  Check the pie frequently to make sure the crust isn’t getting too brown.  If the crust begins to brown too quickly, cover with foil or use a pie shield.","Remove and cool for 3-4 hours before serving."]
