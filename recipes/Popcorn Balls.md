ingredients: ["⅓ cup water","¼ cup unsalted butter (plus additional for buttering bowl, spatula and hands)","⅓ cup light corn syrup","1 cup granulated sugar","1 teaspoon kosher salt","1 teaspoon vanilla extract","12-13 cups of popped popcorn* (1 cup of unpopped popcorn kernels)"]
serves: 12
time: "30 minutes"
prepTime: "20 minutes"
instructions: ["Use my microwave popcorn method. Place ½ cup popcorn kernels in a glass microwave safe bowl. Cover bowl with microwave safe plate. Microwave for 2-5 minutes, or until there are 1-2 seconds between popping kernels. (*mine took exactly 5 minutes). Carefully remove the bowl from the microwave. It will be hot.","Pour popped popcorn into a very large buttered bowl and set aside. I like to use the top of a cake saver.  It’s deep enough to hold all the popcorn and makes it super easy to stir when adding the sauce. You'll need to make TWO batches of microwave popcorn, for a total of 1 cup kernels, and about 12 cups popped corn.","In a medium saucepan, add water and butter and heat over medium low heat until the butter is melted.","Add in the corn syrup, sugar and salt and continue heating over medium low heat, stirring constantly with a metal spoon, until the mixture starts to simmer. There will be tiny bubbles that begin to form around the edge of the pot. When the entire surface is covered with bubbles, the sauce is at a simmer. This will take about 5 minutes.","Continue to heat, over medium-low heat, stirring constantly. Continue to check the temperature of the sauce with a digital or candy thermometer until it reaches temperature of between 235- 240℉. This will take approximately 7-8 minutes. Remove the sauce from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract.","Drizzle the sauce over the popped popcorn and stir with a buttered rubber spatula, until all the popcorn is coated. Make sure the sauce that has collected on the bottom of the bowl is evenly distributed. Let the popcorn mixture cool slightly and lay out a large piece of parchment paper or waxed paper on the countertop.  ","With buttered hands, cup the popcorn mixture, pressing together lightly, until it holds together and forms a ball, about the size of a baseball. Place on the parchment or waxed paper to set. Repeat until all the popcorn mixture has been formed into balls.","Cool and transfer the popcorn balls into individual baggies that seal or use fold top baggies and tie with festive ribbon."]
