instructions: ["For the dough, in a large mixing bowl, combine, flours, yeast, salt and sugar. Slowly add water and olive oil. Mix with a paddle attachment for 2 minutes. Remove and use dough hook to knead dough for 2-3 minutes. Remove and put in a greased bowl. Cover with saran wrap and allow to rise 2 hours in a warm place (I put it on top of my dryer). Divide dough into two balls. Using hands, knead 1 Tbsp of softened butter into each dough ball. Put into a 9inch cake pan (or deep dish pizza pan) and allow to rise and additional 1-2 hours in a warm place.","Brown italian sausage in a large skillet, breaking up into small chunks. Make sure your sausage is removed from the casings. If you can't find the HOT Italian sausage, add a pinch or two of red pepper flakes. Drain sausage completely.","In a large pot, combine tomatoes, salt, pepper, oregano, basil and garlic salt. Simmer while dough rises on low heat (about 1-2 hours).","When ready to assemble pizzas, press dough lightly with fingertips to bottom and sides of pan. Lay 2 cups of shredded cheese in bottom of pizza. Top with browned sausage and about 2 1/2 cups of sauce.","Bake in a 450 degree oven for 25 minutes. Allow to sit for about 10 minutes. Slice and eat. ENJOY!"]
