instructions: ["Line a 9-inch square baking dish with foil. Butter the foil. Set aside.","In the top of a double boiler, combine the heavy cream wi th the sweetened condensed milk. Heat pan over low heat until milk and cream are warm. Keep on a low simmer, stirring occasionally.","In a large 3-4 quart saucepan, combine the sugar, corn syrup, and salt. Heat over medium heat until boiling, stirring with a wooden spoon. Attach a candy thermometer to the side of the pan.","Very slowly, over medium heat, add 1/4 cup of the warmed cream mxture to the boiling sugar mixture, while stirring with a wooden spoon. Wait about 3 minutes between each addition of cream (this process will take about 45 minutes). Be sure to continuously stir the mixture.","Once all the additions of the warm cream have been added, monitor the candy thermometer until it reaches 242 degrees F.","Remove from heat and immediately stir in the vanilla extract. Quickly pour the caramel into the buttered foil-lined baking dish.","Allow caramel to set at room temperature for several hours, or overnight.","To cut the caramels, lift out of the pan and place onto a cutting board. Remove the foil. With a large, sharp knife cut the candy into long strips (about 1-inch wide). Turn pan and cut the candy in the opposite direction in about 1 1/2-inch pieces (they will be the size of a small tootsie roll).","Wrap candy in small pieces of plastic wrap or parchment paper. Cut 5-inch squares of plastic wrap or parchment paper, place the caramel on top, roll the caramels, then twist both ends."]
