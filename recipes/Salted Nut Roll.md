ingredients: ["1/2 cup unsalted butter","7 ounces marshmallow cream","5 cups powdered sugar","1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract","2 (11 ounce) bags caramel bits","2 tablespoons unsalted butter","2 cups chopped peanuts"]
serves: 48
time: "2 hours 40 minutes"
prepTime: "40 minutes"
instructions: ["Melt the butter and marshmallow cream in the microwave, about 30-60seconds, until butter is fully melted.","In a large mixing bowl, combine melted butter and marshmallow to the powdered sugar and vanilla. Cream together until just blended.","Drop onto a silpat (or large piece of parchment paper). Use your hands to knead the “dough” into a large ball.","Divide the ball into 6 equal portions. You’ll then want to use your hands to roll each portion into a 7-8-inch log (the key is to keep it 1-inch thick around).","Wrap each log in parchment paper and freeze two hours until firm.","Melt caramel bits and butter in an 11x7-inch baking dish in the microwave, about 1 1/2 minutes, until smooth. The mixture will be thick, and the butter will separate from the caramel. That’s OKAY.","Allow caramel to cool slightly, then using your hands, combine the butter into the caramel and press the mixture into the bottom of the baking dish. Score it into 6 equal portions.","To cover the marshmallow centers, unwrap the frozen log and using your hands, take one section of caramel and spread it over the center completely. It will feel like you’re working with playdoh.","Once the entire log is covered, press the chopped peanuts into the caramel. Re-wrap in parchment paper and refrigerate. Repeat for each log.","When ready to enjoy, slice each log into 1-inch pieces."]
