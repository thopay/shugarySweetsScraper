instructions: ["Preheat oven to 350 degree F. Prepare cupcake tin with cupcake liners. Set aside.","In a large mixing bowl, combine sugar, flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Add in eggs, milk, oil and vanilla and beat for about 2 minutes.","Slow add in the boiling water and beat for 2 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary. Cupcake batter will be very thin, it's okay!","Fill prepared cupcake tins, about 2/3 full (I use this metal scoop) and bake for 22-25 minutes. Remove and cool completely on wire rack.","Combine filling ingredients in a metal bowl set over a saucepan of boiling water. Using a handheld electric mixer, beat on high speed until frosting is thick and fluffy, about 6 or 7 minutes.","Remove bowl from heat and beat an additional 2 minutes. Reserve about 1/2 cup of filling to use for the swirls on top.","Once cupcakes are completely cooled, add the filling in one of two ways. Fill a piping bag and add an open tip to the end of the bag. Press the tip into the top of the cupcake and squeeze to add filling. You will see the cupcake expand. Pull out and repeat for remaining cupcakes. OR, cut the top of the cupcake using the cone method.","In a small saucepan (or double boiler), heat cream and butter until warm (do not boil). Remove from heat and add chocolate. Stir until smooth.","Spread over the top of each cupcake in a thin layer. For the final touch, add the reserved filling to a piping bag with a small tip. Pipe on small swirls. ENJOY."]
