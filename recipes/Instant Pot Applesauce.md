prepTime: "10 minutes"
instructions: ["Start by peeling your apples. I used sliced Crunch Pak apples, so grabbing a paring knife and peeling the apples took no time at all. For about 1 quart of applesauce, you'll need about 2 lbs of apples.","Toss your apples into the bottom of the pressure cooker and add 1/2 cup of water. Or for a deeper flavor use apple juice or apple cider.","Add 1 Tbsp of sugar. Totally optional, but if you like your applesauce sweetened, this is a good guide.","If you're looking for cinnamon flavor, add in 2 tsp cinnamon. ","If using fresh apples, you may want to squeeze half a lemon in there.","Close the Instant Pot and pressure cook (manual) for 6 minutes. Once it is done, allow it to Natural Release for 6 minutes. Then quick release until the pressure is out.","This is where an immersion blender comes in handy! Open the pressure cooker and blend until desired consistency. If you don't own an Immersion Blender, you can use a regular blender or a food processor. ","Once smooth (or chunky, whichever you prefer), place in a quart size mason jar or bowl. Serve warm or refrigerate until ready to use. ENJOY."]
