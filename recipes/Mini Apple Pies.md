You should be able to get 12 dough rounds from the 2 pie crusts. Optional: Re-roll any remaining pieces and cut out other shapes that you can use as decoration on top. Chill cut out pieces in the fridge until you’re ready to decorate.","Place a circle of pie crust in each hole of  2 standard 6-count muffin pan or 1 12-count pan and gently press the dough down the bottom and the sides. Refrigerate the pans with the crust until ready to be filled.","To make the filling, combine the chopped apples, sugar, flour, ground cinnamon, vanilla extract, and ground nutmeg in a large mixing bowl. Remove the muffin pans from the fridge and fill each hole evenly with the filling mixture.","Optional: Place the shapes you cut out earlier from the excess dough on top of the filling as a decoration. Brush it with an egg wash and sprinkle a little sugar for some color and shine when done baking.","Bake the mini apple pies at 425°F for 25 minutes or until the pie crust and the dough decorations are lightly golden brown and the filling is bubbly. Remove from the oven and cool on the pan for 10-15 minutes. Mini pies should be removed from the pan and transferred to a wire rack to finish cooling."]
