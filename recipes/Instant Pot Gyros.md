ingredients: ["1 teaspoon olive oil","2 pound flank steak","1 Tablespoon dried parsley","1 teaspoon black pepper","1 medium red onion, sliced","3 cloves garlic, minced","½ cup low-sodium beef broth","1 Tablespoon lemon juice","1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar","1 cup shredded lettuce","1 cup chopped tomatoes","1 cup chopped cucumber","½ cup feta cheese","4 whole wheat pita breads, cut into halves","1 cup tzatziki sauce**"]
serves: 6
time: "27 minutes"
prepTime: "20 minutes"
instructions: ["Select SAUTE on the Instant Pot and add the olive oil.","Season both sides of the flank steak with parsley and pepper. Cut the steak into thin strips, going against the grain.","Add the onions, garlic and steak strips to the Instant Pot. Saute for 1-2 minutes, just until the steak begins to brown and the garlic and onions are fragrant.","Add the beef broth, lemon juice, and apple cider vinegar to the Instant Pot.  Using a wooden spoon, scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the Instant Pot.  This is called deglazing and prevents a burn notice from happening while cooking.","Put the lid on and lock it in place. Make sure the valve is set to SEALING.  Select the MANUAL or HIGH PRESSURE setting and set the cook time for 7 minutes.","While the steak is cooking, prepare your tzatziki sauce if you haven't done so earlier.","When the cooking time has completed, allow the pressure to release naturally for 10 minutes, and then to do a quick release of the remaining pressure by moving the valve on the lid to VENTING.  ","For serving, add some shredded lettuce, chopped tomato, chopped cucumber and feta cheese to one half of the pita bread. Add steak and top it with a spoonful of Tzatziki Sauce.","Store meat and sauce in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Freeze meat for up to 6 months."]
