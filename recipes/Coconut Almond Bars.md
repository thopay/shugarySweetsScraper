prepTime: "10 minutes"
instructions: ["Preheat oven to 350°F. On a large baking sheet, spread out coconut into a single layer. Bake for 10-15 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes. Coconut should be lightly browned when done. Remove and cool.","For the crust, beat together butter, corn syrup, brown sugar, almond extract, and egg yolk until smooth. Add in flour, baking powder, and salt and beat until fully combined.","Pat dough into the bottom of a greased 13x9-inch baking dish. Bake for 5- 6 minutes (it will not be fully cooked) in a 350°F oven.","While crust is baking, combined the toasted coconut, almond extract, sweetened condensed milk in a bowl. Drop by tablespoon onto the partially baked crust. Return to oven and bake an additional 20-22 minutes, until edges of crust are lightly browned.","Remove from oven and sprinkle with milk chocolate chips immediately. Drizzle caramel sauce over the top and add sliced almonds. Allow to cool completely. Once cooled, cover and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before slicing and serving.","I prefer to store this in the refrigerator to keep the bars from getting too soft. ENJOY."]
