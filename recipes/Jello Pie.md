instructions: ["In a food processor, pulse graham crackers into fine crumbs. Add sugar and pulse a few times. Add melted butter. Pulse until crumbly.","Pour mixture into 9-inch pie plate. Using the bottom of a measuring cup, or the palm of your hand, firmly flatten and compress the crumb mixture. Press the crust up the sides of the dish first, making sure the crust is high enough to hold the filling, and then work on the flat surface.","Freeze crust while making the filling.","For the filling, stir the strawberry jello mix and boiling water together with a spoon or spatula in a large bowl until the jello mix has completely dissolved.","Slowly add the cold water to the mix while continuing to stir.","Fold in the Cool Whip, and mix until everything is combined with no lumps. (Make sure to take your time to make sure the mix is lump-free.) Place the mixture in the refrigerator, and chill for 30 minutes. Stir the mixture in case the whipped topping and jello have separated, then place it back in the refrigerator for another 30 minutes.","Take the jello mixture out of the refrigerator and stir, scraping the bottom of the bowl, to make sure it’s still well mixed.","Pour the filling into the graham cracker crust, and place back in the refrigerator for 4 hours, or until the filling has set.","Top with whipped cream and fresh strawberries, if desired, and serve chilled."]
