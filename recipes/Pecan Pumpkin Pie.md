instructions: ["Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lay pie crust in bottom of a deep 9-inch pie plate.","In a small bowl, beat 1 egg, and brush the egg wash over the entire pie crust. Bake the crust for ten minutes. Remove from oven and set aside.","For the pumpkin pie layer, in a large bowl, mix the pumpkin puree, sugar, and brown sugar with a whisk.","Add the cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, and salt, and whisk again.","Add the remaining 3 eggs and whisk until just combined. Be careful not to over-mix the eggs or you may risk having the pie filling crack while baking. Pour in the heavy whipping cream and stir just until mixed.","Pour the pumpkin filling into the prepared crust, and bake for 50-55 minutes or until the filling is a dark brown (not burnt) and still slightly jiggly in the middle.","For the pecan topping, in a medium or large bowl, whisk the brown sugar, corn syrup, and maple syrup together. Add the chopped and halved pecans and stir with a wooden spoon or spatula until the pecans are coated in the sugar mix.","Spoon the pecans over the baked pumpkin pie, and then bake for an additional 15 minutes.        ","Rest the pie on a cooling rack until it has reached room temperature, at least 1 hour, then chill for 3 hours or until you are ready to serve."]
