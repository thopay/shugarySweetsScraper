instructions: ["Preheat oven to 400℉. Unroll refrigerated pie crust (or use homemade pie crust) and place in a 9-inch pie plate.","Cover with a piece of parchment paper and place pie weights or dried beans on top to prevent the crust from bubbling up and shrinking during blind baking. Bake for 12-15 minutes, until the crust is just starting to brown.","While the crust is baking, make the glaze. In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar, cornstarch, and water, whisking continuously until the mixture is boiling. Cook over medium-low heat for about 2 minutes, until thickened and the cornstarch is dissolved.","Remove from heat and whisk in the strawberry gelatin powder until dissolved. Set aside to cool or refrigerate for about 20 minutes.","Take the crust out of the oven and remove the parchment and weights. Set the crust aside to cool.","Place sliced berries in the baked pie crust. Pour or spoon the cooled jello mixture over the berries. ","Refrigerate for 5 hours or overnight for best results. ","Cut and serve topped with whipping cream."]
