serves: 20
time: "4 hours 45 minutes"
prepTime: "15 minutes"
instructions: ["Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray deep 13x9 baking dish with baking spray, or grease and flour. Set aside.","In a large mixing bowl, beat cake mix with bananas, water, and vegetable oil for 2 minutes. Add eggs and beat an additional two minutes.","Pour into prepared pan. Bake for 30-35 minutes. Remove and cool for 15 minutes.","Using the handle of a wooden spoon, or a meat thermometer, poke holes all over the cake.","In a bowl, whisk together the milk with banana pudding mix. Allow to sit two minutes until it begins to slightly thicken. Pour half over the warm cake, waiting a minute or two until it seeps into the holes (use an offset spatula to help). Then slowly pour the remaining pudding over the top, being careful not to let it run over the sides of the pan. (The cake will slowly absorb some of the pudding mix and soften down).","Refrigerate cake 4 hours or overnight. When ready to serve, spread Cool Whip over the top and add crushed cookies."]
