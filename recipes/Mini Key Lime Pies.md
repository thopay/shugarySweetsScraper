instructions: ["Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 12-cup muffin pan with 12 cupcake liners and set aside.","In a mixing bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, brown sugar, and melted butter using a fork.","Press about two tablespoons of the graham cracker mixture into the bottom of each cupcake liner, and bake for 5 minutes.","While the crusts are baking, make the filling. Combine the 2 cans of condensed milk, key lime juice, and key lime zest in a large bowl. Whisk until the juice is thoroughly mixed. Add the egg yolks, and continue to whisk until the yolks are just combined. Do not over-mix the yolks.","Pour the pie filling into each cupcake liner until almost full, about 3 Tablespoons each (I use a large cookie scoop for this).","Bake the mini pies for 13-15 minutes or until the filling is completely set but not bubbling.","Set the pies on a cooling rack for 1 hour, then cover (or place in an airtight container) and chill in the refrigerator for 3 hours, but overnight is best.","Carefully remove the cupcake liners from the pies, top with whipped cream and lime zest, and serve chilled."]
