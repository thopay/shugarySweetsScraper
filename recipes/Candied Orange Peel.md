instructions: ["To prepare oranges, remove peel from orange the best way you know how. I have a little orange peel tool, but you can slice your orange in quarters and then peel off the skin.","In large pot, put orange peels with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil and boil uncovered for 30 minutes. Drain and repeat twice.","In separate saucepan, bring 1 cup sugar, 1 1/2 cup water and salt to a boil. Continue boiling for about 2 minutes until sugar is dissolved. Add prepared, drained peel (from above) to the syrup. Bring to a boil again, reduce heat. Simmer, uncovered for about one hour. Drain any remaining liquid.","Allow orange peel to cool in a single layer on a foil lined baking sheet for at least an hour. Cut into strips. Sprinkle with 2 cups of sugar, tossing to coat. Let stand on foil lined baking sheet overnight, until dried (about 12 hours)."]
