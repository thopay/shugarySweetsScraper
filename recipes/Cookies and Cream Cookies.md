instructions: ["Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, set aside.","Crush Oreos in a ziploc bag, just one smash per Oreo with a meat tenderizer should be enough (you don't need to make fine crumbs here). Set aside.","In a large mixing bowl, combine melted butter with brown sugar. Mix until completely blended. Add in eggs and vanilla extract until fully combined.","Add flour, cocoa powder, kosher salt, and baking soda to mixing bowl. Beat just until incorporated. Fold in all but ½ cup of the white chocolate chips and 1/4 cup of the Oreo cookies.","Using a 2 Tbsp cookie scoop, drop dough two inches apart on prepared cookie sheet. Press 3 or 4 white chocolate chips and 1-2 pieces of crushed Oreo cookie to the top of each cookie before baking.","Bake for 10-12 minutes. The cookies will be slightly underbaked, but not runny. Allow to cool on baking sheet 5-10 minutes before moving to a wire rack to cool completely."]
