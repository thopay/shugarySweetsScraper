instructions: ["First, you’ll need a 7×3-inch cake pan. I use the Fat Daddio Push Pan (which is also perfect for Instant Pot Cheesecake!). Spray with baking spray and set aside.","In a bowl, whisk egg until fluffy (about 15 seconds). Add milk and oil. Add flour, cornmeal, sugar, kosher salt, and baking powder.","Pour batter into prepared pan. Wrap top in foil, then take a second piece of foil and wrap the bottom too.","Pour 1 cup of water into the bottom of the Instant Pot.","Place foil wrapped pan on a sling (or trivet) and lower into the pressure cooker.","Lock the lid and make sure the valve is set to “SEALING.”","Select HIGH PRESSURE and a cook time of 55 minutes.","When the cook time ends, allow pressure to naturally release for 10 minutes, then do a quick release of the valve.","Wipe off the excess moisture from the top of the foil and remove foil completely.","Slice and enjoy warm."]
